# Maintenance and Inspection Overview

#### Intro and contents

Effective maintenance scheduling is required for maximising uptime and hence effectiveness/profitability of most systems. It's critical to determine how frequently maintenance should be carried out, as well as the optimal types to perform. 

As such, it's important to be able to numerically quantify failure rates of parts in the context of a maintenance method. This is what's performed here.
