## MDAO-like frameworks

We call what's described in [[Uncertainty in management Overview]] as Multidisciplinary Design Analysis & Optimisation (MDAO) problems. 

Within this field, collaborative design optimization is an active area of research, as such there are quite a few frameworks designed to help manage them.
- These methods were developed in response to the distributed way in which engineers actually work
- Examples include Concurrent subspace optimization
