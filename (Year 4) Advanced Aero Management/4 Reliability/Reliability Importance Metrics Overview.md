# Reliability Importance Metrics Overview

#### Intro and contents

Beyond simply determining the reliability of a system, a [[complex reliability model|reliability model]] let's us determine the significant contributors to the reliability of the whole system or it's parts. A critical tool which can help here is importance metrics, which can help to numerically identify parts of the system we may want to focus resources on improving.

Weâ€™ve seen a number of different metrics for determining the importance of a component in a system, each has a specific use case, and it is important to remember that no single importance metric is valid for all system configurations.

Hence often a combination of metrics may be a better approach, for example, a weighted sum of different metrics.

Further, all conclusions need to keep the time in mind. The importance of components can change drastically depending on the time frame we look at.
