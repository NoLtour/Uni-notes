## Aleatory and epistemic uncertainty

Although these terms sound somewhat daunting, they're quite simple:
- Aleatory uncertainty - These are objective uncertainties, generally due to physical nature (temp, material, geometry ect) we can never completely remove them only reduce/increase them. They are [[stochastic]] and modelled using some sort of [[probability density function|PDF]]. Often described as "known unknowns".
- Epistemic uncertainty - These are subjective uncertainties, they are the intrinsic error that exist in all engineering models that are approximations of reality, hence numerically incorrect. Since engineering models are an attempt at approximating the truth, we know them to deviate from reality but quantifying exactly how much is impossible. These arise from lack of knowledge and are the "unknown unknowns".

Of course we can attempt to compensate for [[aleatory and epistemic uncertainty|epistemic uncertainty]] by making margins more conservative, slapping on safety factors ect; although these margins are based on observations of "what's practical", they are ultimately "[[we ball|educated guesses]]".
