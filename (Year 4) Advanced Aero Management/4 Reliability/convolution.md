## Convolution

convolution is an operation that combines two functions to produce a third function, expressing how the shape of one function is modified by another. Itâ€™s defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is flipped and shifted:

> ### $$\begin{align*} (f * g) (t) &=  \int^{\infty}_{\infty} f(\tau) \: g(t-\tau) d\tau \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $f*g=$ is the convolution of f in terms of g (order matters!)
>> $f(t)=$ input function being convolved (or signal function)
>> $g(t)=$ function of the kernel (or filter function)

For the convolution to yield a useful result, you'll have the kernel $g(t)$ have a [[absolutely integrable|finite area]]. Convolution can be done (approximately) numerically or analytically, it's INSANELY useful just a bit confusing at first.

There exists extension of convolution into 2D and 3D sets, but it's easiest to see for a 1D function:

The simplest use is for averaging, which can be done very effectively with a square wave or Gaussian. That said, it's useful in doing far far more complex operations such as edge finding.
