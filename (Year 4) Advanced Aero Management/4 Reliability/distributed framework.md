## Distributed framework

A distributed framework refers to a system where the design process is spread across multiple teams or components, each working on their own sub-problem but still contributing to the overall system. In this setup, each team or designer has control over specific aspects of the design, but the results are coordinated to ensure consistency and achieve the systemâ€™s goals.
