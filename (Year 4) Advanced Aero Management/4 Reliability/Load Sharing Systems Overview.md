# Load Sharing Systems Overview

#### Intro and contents
So far we've considered relatively simple systems, where the failure of each component doesn't effect the [[probability density function|PDFs]] of other components.

This is quite unrealistic, most components are under some sort of load, if another fails its load increases. Consider power plants for instance, if we have 5 in parallel and one fails, then the load and hence wear on the others increases, changing their [[probability density function|PDFs]].

Modelling load sharing is what we consider today.
