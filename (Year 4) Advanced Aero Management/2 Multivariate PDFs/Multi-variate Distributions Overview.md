# Multi-variate Distributions Overview

#### Intro
Previously we've looked at a number of [[probability density function]]'s, with them all being single variable ([[independent events|independent]]). Question is, is that realistic? Answer, no. In real systems we have countless variables which effect each other ([[dependent events]]), here we will be introducing that concept.
Consider the [[probability density function|PDF]] for the failure of a rod, the cycles till failure depend on:
- Force applied (which may be subject to randomness)
- Variation in geometry
- Purity of material
- Existence of manufacturing defects
- Operating temperature
Things like the purity, geometry and defects will likely be somewhat correlated, making them dependent on each other. If a batch has geometry defects, chances are it has more defects in other ways.
