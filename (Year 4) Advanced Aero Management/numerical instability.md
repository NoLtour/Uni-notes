## Numerical instability
Numerical instability refers to errors in numerical computations that can grow exponentially, leading to inaccurate results. It typically occurs in algorithms that amplify small perturbations in data or round-off errors during calculations, particularly in iterative processes.

Using logarithmic transformations can help mitigate numerical instability in certain cases
