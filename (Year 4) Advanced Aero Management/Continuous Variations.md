# Continuous Variations

#### Intro and contents
Understanding and modelling the variations of parameters is critical, this is the very core of statistics. Previous work has largely been on gaussian distributions, but in engineering that is rarely sufficient.

Here we plot the frequency of the subtle variations in angle for a manufactured turbine blade, which can then be fed into a angle vs time failure model. Compounding models onto each other allows us to get idea's on outcomes with less testing ([[aka the main purpose of engineering|forshadowning]]), as you can imagine these can get complex fast.

The functions:
- [[probability density function]]
- [[cumulative distribution function]]
- [[reliability function]]
- [[hazard function]]
Nice thing about these, is any single one can be used to define the other.
