#### Describe
## DC machines wound fields
So previously we described how it is advantageous to use electromagnets instead of permanent magnets in DC machines because it allows you to vary field intensity thereby giving control over [[magnetic loading]] and all properties based on that (such as power).

Previously we discussed using a [[prime mover (DC motor field connection)|PM]], but there are other options as well:
- [[separate excitation (DC motor field connection)]]
- [[series excitation (DC motor field connection)]]
- [[separate excitation (DC motor field connection)]]
- [[separate excitation (DC motor field connection)]]
