#### What is the
## Relationship between power and volume of a DC motor
[[relationship between torque and volume of a DC motor#^85fb78]] and [[DC motor power#^793251]]:
$$\begin{align*}
T &= 2BA V_{R} & P &= T \omega \\
& & P &= 2BA V_{R} \omega\\
& & P \frac{1}{2BA} &= V_{R} \omega
\end{align*}$$
Both [[magnetic loading]] and [[electric loading]] are generally simular for DC machines regardless of size the above expression can be

> ### $$ V_{R} \propto \frac{p}{\omega} $$
