#### What is the
## Relationship between torque and volume of a DC motor
We know from [[DC motor]]:
![[DC motor#^be3198]]

We also know from [[EMF constant (DC generator)|EMF constant]]:
![[EMF constant (DC generator)#^81dae1]]

$$\begin{align*}
T &= K_{E} i & K_{E} &= \frac{zDBL}{2a}\\
 &= \frac{zDBL}{2a} i\\
&= z/a
\end{align*}$$
