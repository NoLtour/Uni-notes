#### How can we use
## Complex numbers for representing AC
So [[complex numbers]] are actually ideal for this, especially when dealing with sinasoidal waveforms, take the following equation:

Then by focusing on the real component we get a convenient way to represent the current voltage of some AC source:

So a equation that represents the current voltage of some sinasodal AC source can be written as:
> ### $$ V_{p}(\cos(\omega t + \phi ) + i\sin(\omega t + \phi )) = $$
