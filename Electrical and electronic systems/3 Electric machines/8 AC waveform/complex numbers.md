#### What are
## Complex numbers
### Contents
These are numbers with a real and imaginary component, basically the number line we usually use is one dimentional complex numbers are adding another dimention simular to [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]].

If your not [[absolute guarbage|cringe]] then you use $i$ when working with complex numbers but sometimes we use $j$ (usually in electronics probably because $i$ is already used for [[electric current|current]]). ^60fc2b

Basically:
> ### $$ i = \sqrt{-1} $$

And:
> ### $$ x = a + ib $$ 
>> where:
>> $x=$ some variable
>> $a=$ real component
>> $b=$ imaginary component
>> $a,b=$ real numbers
>> $i=\sqrt{-1}$ 

I'm not going to go into detail but adding and multiplying works basically the same as with most [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]] except with the added benefit that $i^{2}=-1$ so simplification becomes more convenient.

It should also be kept in mind that complex numbers are often represented using angle and magnitude if only there was [[representing complex numbers using angle and magnitude|some page discussing this]]....

### Examples

Then to express a number like $-69$ we would:
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt{-69} &= \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{69}\\
&= i \sqrt{69}
\end{align*}$$

It should be noted that $i$ can of course be squared $i^{2} = -1$ and that numbers can have complex and real components simultaniously:

$$\begin{align*}
x &= (2+i)^{2}\\
&= 2+4i+i^{2}\\
&= 2+4i-1\\
&= 2+3i
\end{align*}$$
