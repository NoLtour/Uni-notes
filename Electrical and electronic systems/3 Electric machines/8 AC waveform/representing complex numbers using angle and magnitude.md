#### What are the methods for
## Representing complex numbers using angle and magnitude
Basically look at this diagram representing some [[complex numbers|complex number]]

The anticlockwise angle between the real axis and the complex number is $\theta$, thats basically it lol. (if you wanted you could [[what do you mean this is supposed to be an educational thing|figure the rest out for yourself]] quite intuitively)

Ok so a bit more development, just like [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]] magnitude is represented using $|N|$ around the variable representing the vector, with complex numbers you can represent them using the following equations (a bit more than usual because of the equations derived from $i^{2}=-1$):
> ### $$ N = a+ib = M(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta) = Me^{\frac{i\theta}{2\pi}} $$
