#### Describe
## DC machines wound fields
So previously we described how it is advantageous to use electromagnets instead of permanent magnets in DC machines because it allows you to vary field intensity thereby giving control over [[magnetic loading]] and all properties based on that (such as power).

Previously we discussed using a [[prime mover (DC machine field connection)|PM]], but there are other options as well:
- [[separate excitation (DC machine field connection)]]
- [[series excitation (DC machine field connection)]]
- [[shunt (DC machine field connection)]]
- [[compound (DC machine field connection)]]

Here you can see the relationship between speed and torque for some of the configurations:

As you can imagine depending on the use case of the machine you may choose a different configuration.
