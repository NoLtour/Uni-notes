#### What is
## Magnetic loading ($B$)
The total flux in the air gap of a machine is called magnetic loading. It is measured in [[tesla]]. This loading sets the limit on working flux without saturation.

>> $B=$ [[magnetic loading]]
>> $N_{p}=$ number of poles
>> $\phi_{p}=$ [[magnetic flux]] per pole
