#### What is
## Magnetic loading ($B$)
The total flux in the air gap of a machine is called magnetic loading. It is measured in [[tesla]]. This loading sets the limit on working flux without saturation.

>> $B=$ [[magnetic loading]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]] (around core?)
>> $A=$ area (around core?)
