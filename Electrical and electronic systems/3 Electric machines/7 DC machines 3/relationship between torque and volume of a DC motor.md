#### What is the
## Relationship between torque and volume of a DC motor

> ### $$ T =  \frac{DLB zi_{c}}{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $T=$ torque 
>> $B=$ [[magnetic loading]]
>> $D=$ rotor diameter
>> $i_{c}=$ current in conductors [[UNFINISHED STUFF]]
>> $z=$ number of conductors
>> $L-$ length of rotor

> ### $$ T = 2BA V_{R} $$ 
>> where:
>> $T=$ torque
>> $B=$ [[magnetic loading]]
>> $A=\frac{zi_{c}}{\pi D}=$ [[electric loading]]
>> $V_{R}=$ Volume of rotor
