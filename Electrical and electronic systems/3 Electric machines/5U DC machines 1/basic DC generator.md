#### Describe a
## Basic DC generator
Recalling the design for a simple AC generator:

A DC generator basically works the same way, except instead of 2 slip rings there is only one, and the slip ring is split into two halfs:

The cut is made in a way so that the contacts reverse at the instant the current changes directions, hence AC becomes DC. The ring cannot be called a [[slip ring]] anymore, it is a [[commutator]].

Of course even with the currents direction corrected, the magnitude of [[electromotive force|EMF]] still follows a sin wave in the form $E=|\sin t|$
