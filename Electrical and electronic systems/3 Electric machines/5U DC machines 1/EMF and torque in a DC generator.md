#### Explain and define mathamatically the
## EMF and torque in a DC generator
### The physics
Just like with [[synchronous generators|AC generators]] the current is produced due to [[faraday's law]], an induced current in the wire causes a force perpendicular to the magnetic field lines due to the [[Lorentz's force law|lorentz force]], this resaults in a force that acts against the driving force... hence greater currents result in a greater driving force needed:

I'm not going to write out the maths but for a single coil of wire $EMF \propto sin\alpha$
