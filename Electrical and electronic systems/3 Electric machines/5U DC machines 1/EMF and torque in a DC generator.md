#### Explain and define mathamatically the
## EMF and torque in a DC generator
### The physics
Just like with [[synchronous generators|AC generators]] the current is produced due to [[faraday's law]], an induced current in the wire causes a force perpendicular to the magnetic field lines due to the [[Lorentz's force law|lorentz force]], this resaults in a force that acts against the driving force... hence greater currents resault in a greater driving force needed:
