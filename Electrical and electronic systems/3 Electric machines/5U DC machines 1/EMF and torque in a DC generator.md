#### Explain and define mathamatically the
## EMF and torque in a DC generator
### The physics
Just like with [[synchronous generators|AC generators]] the current is produced due to [[faraday's law]]

The verticle component of the force can be defined as $F_{V} = F\sin\alpha$ and we know that $\omega = $
