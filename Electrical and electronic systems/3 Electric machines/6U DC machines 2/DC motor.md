#### Describe a
## DC motor
Basically you know everything that was covered in [[DC machines 1 notes]], well basically it all also applies to DC motors. Difference is you run a current through them and they produce a force instead:

> ### $$ T = K_{E} i $$ 
>> where:
>> $T=$ torque 
>> $i=$ current
>> $K_{E}=$ [[EMF constant (DC generator)|EMF constant]]

(The slides show another constant called the torque constant ($K_{T}$, but instantly prooves that $K_{T}=K_{E}$ so why the fuck does it even exist?!? Until it's exsistance gets justified I'ma pretend it doesn't exist [[UNFINISHED LIGHT (tm)|UNFINISHED (LIGHT)]])

The other equations and theory from [[EMF and torque in a DC generator]] and [[equivalent circuit of a DC generator]] still apply, just with a negative generator emf.
