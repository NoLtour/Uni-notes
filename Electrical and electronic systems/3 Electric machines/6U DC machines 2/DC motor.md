#### Describe a
## DC motor
Basically you know everything that was covered in [[DC machines 1 notes]], well basically it all also applies to DC motors. Difference is you run a current through them and they produce a force instead:

> ### $$ T = K_{E} $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $K_{E}=$ [[EMF constant (DC generator)|EMF constant]]

(The slides show another constant called the torque constant ($K_{T}$, but instantly prooves that $K_{T}=K_{E}$ so why the fuck does it even exist?!? Until it's exsistance gets justified I'ma pretend it doesn't exist)
