#### What is
## Flux linkage ($\lambda$)
The general definition of flux linkage is the product of the number of turns in the coil and [[magnetic flux]], or expressed mathamatically:

> ### $$ \lambda = N \phi $$ 
>> where:
>> $\lambda=$ [[flux linkage]]
>> $N=$ Number of turns in the coil
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]

This is usful for coiled wires, since a single magnetic field line can pass through multiple coils and hence have a greater effect on the coil... so you can use flux linkage to measure the overall effect on the coiled wire by doing the multiplication above.
