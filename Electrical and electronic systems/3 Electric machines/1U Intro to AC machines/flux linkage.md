#### What is
## Flux linkage ($\lambda$)
The general definition of flux linkage is the product of the number of turns in the coil and [[tesla|magnetic flux density]].


> ### $$ \lambda = N \phi $$ 
>> where:
>> $\lambda=$ [[flux linkage]]
>> $N=$ Number of turns in the coil
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
