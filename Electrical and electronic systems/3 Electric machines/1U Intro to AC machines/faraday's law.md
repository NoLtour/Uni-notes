#### What is
## Faraday's law
Faraday's law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a [[magnetic field]] will interact with an electric circuit to produce an [[electromotive force]] ([[electromotive force|EMF]])â€”a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.[[induction]]
