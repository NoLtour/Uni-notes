#### What is
## Faraday's law
Faraday's law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a [[magnetic field]] will interact with an electric circuit to produce an [[electromotive force]] ([[electromotive force|EMF]])â€”a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. 
It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids.

It states "The [[electromotive force]] around a closed path is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the [[magnetic flux]] enclosed by the path."
Or put as an equation for a single coil of wire:

> ### $$ \mathcal {E} = - \frac{d\phi}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\mathcal {E}=$ [[electromotive force|EMF]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
>> $t=$ time

Alternatively for a tightly wound coil of wire:

> ### $$ \mathcal {E} = - N \frac{d\phi}{dt} $$ [[flux linkage]]
>> where:
>> $\mathcal {E}=$ [[electromotive force|EMF]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]] through a single loop
>> $t=$ time
>> $N$ = identical turns of the wire
