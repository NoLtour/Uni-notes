#### What is
## Magnetomotive force

It is the property of certain substances or phenomena that give rise to magnetic fields and can be described by the equation:

> ### $$ F = \phi R = NI $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ [[magnetomotive force]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
>> $N=$ number of turns in coil
>> $I=$ [[electric current]]
>> $R=$ [[magnetic reluctance]]
