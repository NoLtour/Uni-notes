#### What is
## Magnetomotive force
The current flowing in an electric circuit is due to the existence of [[electromotive force]] similarly magnetomotive force (MMF) is required to drive the magnetic flux in the magnetic circuit.
It is the property of certain substances or phenomena that give rise to magnetic fields and can be described by the equation:

> ### $$ F = \phi R = NI $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ [[magnetomotive force]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
>> $N=$ number of turns in coil
>> $I=$ [[electric current]]
>> $R=$ [[magnetic reluctance]]
>[[ohms law]]

It is related to [[Lorentz's force law]]
