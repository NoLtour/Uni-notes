#### What is
## Magnetomotive force
The current flowing in an electric circuit is due to the existence of [[electromotive force]]; similarly the Magnetomotive force (MMF) is defined as the work done in moving a unit magnetic pole once around the magnetic circuit. It is a magnetic pressure that tends to set up magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit.

It can be defined mathamatically using the following equation:

> ### $$ F = \phi R = NI $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ [[magnetomotive force]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
>> $N=$ number of turns in coil
>> $I=$ [[electric current]]
>> $R=$ [[magnetic reluctance]]
>[[ohms law]]

Although it has force in the name, it is not measured in newtons, it is measured in amperes.
