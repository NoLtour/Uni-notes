#### What is
## Faraday's law
Faraday's law of induction is a basic law of electromagnetism predicting how a [[magnetic field]] will interact with an electric circuit to produce an [[electromotive force]] ([[electromotive force|EMF]])â€”a phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. 
It is the fundamental operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of electrical motors, generators and solenoids. ([[kinda the backbone of modern human civilization no big deal|so useful]])

It states "The [[electromotive force]] around a closed path is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the [[magnetic flux]] enclosed by the path."
Or put as an equation for a single coil of wire:

> ### $$ \mathcal {E} = - \frac{d\phi}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\mathcal {E}=$ [[electromotive force|EMF]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]]
>> $t=$ time

Alternatively for a tightly wound coil of wire:

> ### $$ \mathcal {E} = - N \frac{d\phi}{dt} $$
>> where:
>> $\mathcal {E}=$ [[electromotive force|EMF]]
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]] through a single loop
>> $t=$ time
>> $N =$ identical turns of the wire
> 
> (I'm pretty sure that [[flux linkage]] can also be used, so $\mathcal {E} = - \frac{d\lambda}{dt}$ )

### Useful form

What's important to understand is that it is the flux enclosed by the loop, so in a uniform magnetic field it is proportional to AREA in the loop!

Take a look at the diagram, you don't need to care about the [[Lorentz's force law|lorentz force]] or current right now all that's important is $\alpha, D, L$. If we assume the [[tesla|magnetic flux density]] to be constant between the magnets which is generally a resonable approximation inside many electronic machines then:
- We know the area inside the loop is: $A=LD$.
- We know that [[magnetic flux]] is measured using the normal component to the surface, so at $\alpha=0$ flux is at a maximum and at $\alpha=\frac{\pi}{2}$ flux is zero. So the perpendicular component of flux can be defined as: $\phi=AB\cos\alpha$ where $B$ is [[tesla|magnetic flux density]]
- We can also define $\alpha$ interms of angular velocity as $\alpha=t\omega$
- Finally from [[faraday's law]]: $\mathcal {E} = - \frac{d\phi}{dt}$

Now we can sub all this together:
$$\begin{align*}
\mathcal {E}& = - \frac{d\phi}{dt} & \phi&=AB\cos\alpha & \alpha&=t\omega & A&=LD\\
& & &=LD\cos(t\omega)\\
& & \frac{d\phi}{dt} &=-LDB \omega \sin(t\omega)\\
\mathcal {E}& = LDB \omega \sin(t\omega)
\end{align*}$$

Now if we imagine lots of these loops tightly wound ontop of eachother, call the number of loops $N$, the total area becomes $A=NLD$ so our final equation would then become:
$$\begin{align*}
\mathcal {E}& = NLDB \omega \sin(t\omega)
\end{align*}$$

In reality $\omega\sin(t\omega)$ is just a function defining the perpendicular component of the magnetic field with respect to time, so we can write this as out final equation:

> ### $$ \mathcal {E} = NLDB u(t) $$ 
>> where:
>> $u(t)=$ some function describing the perpendicular component of the magnetic field acting on the area at a given time
>> $N=$ number of loops of coil
>> $L=$ length of wire loop
>> $D=$ width of wire loop
>> $B=$ [[tesla|magnetic flux density]]

There is also this, which is what is given as an example. I don't like it because it's more confusing but its in the notes... Here it is assumed the magnetic field is acting out of the page and is uniform while being entirely constrained to the area directly under the ma:
