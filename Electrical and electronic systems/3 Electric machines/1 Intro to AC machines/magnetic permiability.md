#### What is
## Magnetic permiability ($\mu$)
In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. A closely related property of materials is magnetic susceptibility, which is a dimensionless proportionality factor that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.
