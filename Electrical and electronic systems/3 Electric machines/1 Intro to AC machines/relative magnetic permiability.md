#### What is
## Relative magnetic permiability ($\mu_r$)
Relative permeability, denoted by the symbol $\mu_r$, is the ratio of the permeability of a specific medium to the permeability of free space $\mu_0$: 

> ### $$ \mu_{r} = \frac{\mu}{\mu_{0}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\mu_{r}=$ [[relative magnetic permiability]]
>> $\mu =$ [[magnetic permiability]]
>> $\mu_{0}=$ [[permitivity of free space (magnetic)]]
