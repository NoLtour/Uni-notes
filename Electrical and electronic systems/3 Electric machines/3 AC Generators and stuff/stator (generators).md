#### What is a
## Stator (generators)
*(in these notes we focus on AC generators where the magnetic field is rotating and the current is produced in the stationary compontnet)*

### Introduction

The stator is the stationary part of the [[synchronous generators|alternator]]. It carries the armature winding in which the voltage is generated. The output of the alternator is taken form the stator.

### Winding

Most of the time the windings are setup in a way so that we get 3 phase [[alternating current|AC]] generated, this is done by offsetting the sets of windings by 120 degrees:

### Sator core

This is what sator cores generally look like, if you look carefully you can see some surface roughness, this is because sator cores are actually made of lots of thin layers attached together, this is to minamise the effect of [[eddy currents]] and increase efficiency.

The sator core has multiple functions:
- It holds the wires in place
- Conducts heat allowing for efficient cooling
- Has a higher [[magnetic permiability]] than air creating less losses in [[tesla|magnetic flux density]]
Hence why it is made of conductive metals as apos
