#### What is a
## Stator (generators)
*(in these notes we focus on AC generators where the magnetic field is rotating and the current is produced in the stationary compontnet)*

### General layout

The stator is the stationary part of the [[synchronous generators|alternator]]. It carries the armature winding in which the voltage is generated. The output of the alternator is taken form the stator.

Most of the time the windings are setup in a way so that we get 3 phase [[alternating current|AC]] generated, this is done by offsetting the sets of windings by 120 degrees:
