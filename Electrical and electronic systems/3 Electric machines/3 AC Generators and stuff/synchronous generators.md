#### What are
## Synchronous generators
### Introduction
A synchronous generator is a synchronous machine which converts mechanical power into AC electric power through the process of electromagnetic induction.

Synchronous generators are also referred to as alternators or AC generators. The term "alternator" is used since it produces AC power. It is called synchronous generator because it must be driven at synchronous speed to produce AC power of the desired frequency.

A synchronous generator can be either single-phase or poly-phase (generally 3phase).

### Construction
An [[synchronous generators|alternator]] consists of two parts:
- [[stator (generators)|stator]]
- [[rotor (generators)|rotor]]
