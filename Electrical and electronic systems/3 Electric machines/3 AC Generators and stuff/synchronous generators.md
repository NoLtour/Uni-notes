#### What are
## Synchronous generators
### Introduction
A synchronous generator is a synchronous machine which converts mechanical power into AC electric power through the process of electromagnetic induction.

Synchronous generators are also referred to as alternators or AC generators. The term "alternator" is used since it produces AC power. It is called synchronous generator because it must be driven at synchronous speed to produce AC power of the desired frequency.

A synchronous generator can be either single-phase or poly-phase (generally 3phase).

### Construction
An [[synchronous generators|alternator]] consists of two parts:
- [[stator (generators)|stator]]
- [[rotor (generators)|rotor]]

![[stator (generators)#Stator generators]]

![[rotor (generators)#Rotor generators]]

### Function
Basically as the [[rotor (generators)|rotor]] rotates around, the [[tesla|magnetic flux density]] changes at different points in the [[stator (generators)|stator]], then due to [[faraday's law]] 


The frequency of an [[synchronous generators|alternator]] can be found using:
> ### $$ rpm = \frac{120f}{N_{p}} $$
> ### $$ f = \frac{rpm\times N_{p}}{120}$$ 
>> where:
>> $rpm=$ rotations per min 
>> $f=$ frequency
>> $N_{p}=$ Number of poles
