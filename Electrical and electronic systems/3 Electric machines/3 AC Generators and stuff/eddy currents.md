#### What are
## Eddy currents
Eddy currents (also called Foucault's currents) are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing [[magnetic field]] in the conductor according to [[faraday's law]] of induction. Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an [[alternating current|AC]] electromagnet or transformer, for example, or by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of [[magnetic flux|flux]], and inversely proportional to the [[resistivity]] of the material. When graphed, these circular currents within a piece of metal look vaguely like eddies or whirlpools in a liquid.

The currents produce heat, so inside machineary they tend to just be an annoying source of inefficiency.

The power dissipation of eddy currents can be calculated using:
> ### $$ P = \frac{\pi^{2} B_{p}^{2}d^{2}f^{2} }{ 6k\rho D } $$ 
>> where:
>> $B_{p}=$ Peak [[magnetic field]] 
>> $d=$ thickness of sheet/diameter of wire
>> $f=$ frequency
>> $P=$ Power lost per unit mass
>> $k=$ a constant (1 for thin sheet and 2 for thin wire)
>> $D=$ the materials density

(you don't need to know this equation) As you can see since it is proportional to the thickness squared, having lots of very thin sheets instead of thick ones reduces the effect of eddy currents hence why we do it.
