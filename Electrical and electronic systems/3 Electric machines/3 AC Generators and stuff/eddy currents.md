#### What are
## Eddy currents
Eddy currents (also called Foucault's currents) are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing [[magnetic field]] in the conductor according to [[faraday's law]] of induction. Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field. They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an [[alternating current|AC]] electromagnet or transformer, for example, or by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of [[magnetic flux|flux]], and inversely proportional to the [[resistivity]] of the material. When graphed, these circular currents within a piece of metal look vaguely like eddies or whirlpools in a liquid.

The currents produce heat, so inside machineary they tend to just be an annoying source of inefficiency.

The power dissipation of eddy currents can be calculated
