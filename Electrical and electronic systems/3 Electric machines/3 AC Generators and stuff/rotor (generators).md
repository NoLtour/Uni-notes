#### What is a
## Rotor (generators)
### Intro
This is the part that rotates and produces the [[magnetic field]].

There are 2 main types of rotor configuration:
- [[salient pole rotors]]
- [[cylindrical rotors]]

### Structure
#### Field windings
The field windings are wrapped in the rotor to produce a [[magnetic field]], they require a DC source. You might be wondering why no use a perminant magnet; by using an electromagnet it becomes possible to throttle the magnets intensity allowing for control over the behaviour of the [[synchronous generators|alternator]].

#### Solid structural bits
Basically everything that applys to [[stator (generators)#Sator core]] applys to this, mainly
