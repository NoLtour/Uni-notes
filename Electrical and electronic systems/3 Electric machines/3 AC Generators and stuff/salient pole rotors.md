#### What are
## Salient pole rotors

This is where you have windings on poles that stick out of the shaft:

This configuration is relatively easy to manufacture, but it cannot be driven at high speeds because:
- The construction has inherint weaknesses due to its layout
- The shape creates lots of drag when rotating at high speed

Generally to counter it's weaknesses [[salient pole rotors]] have large diameters and short axial lengths. Max operating speeds are usually about 120 to 400 rpm.
