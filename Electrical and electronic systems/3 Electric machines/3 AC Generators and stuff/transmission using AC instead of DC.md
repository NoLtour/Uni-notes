#### What is the reason for energy
## Transmission using [[alternating current|AC]] instead of [[direct current|DC]]

- AC is naturally occuring inside [[synchronous generators|AC generators]] and [[alternating current|AC]] motors
- Easy to switch off since it falls to zero every half cycle
- AC can be easily and efficiently stepped up using a [[transformer]]
