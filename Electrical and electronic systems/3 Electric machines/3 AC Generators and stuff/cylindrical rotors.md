#### What are
## Cylindrical rotors

Cylindrical rotors are quite shockingly cylindrical, ([[unthinkable|I know it's crazy]]):

Although more expensive to produce it has a bunch of benefits which allow it to operate at higher rpm (1500 to 3000 rpm):
- Good mechanical strength
- Low noise and drag at high speeds due to uniform air gap
- [[magnetic flux|Flux]] distrobution around periphery of rotor is nearly a sine wave giving a better waveform

Generally these have a small diameter but a long axial length, cylindrical rotor [[synchronous generators|alternators]] are called [[turbo-alternators]].
