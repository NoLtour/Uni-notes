#### What is
## Equivalent circuit of a DC generator
### General equivalent circuit
Here we place a resistor and [[inductor]] in series with the generator to represent it's properties.

We can get the EMF from [[EMF and rpm in a DC generator#^9a26aa]]

> ### $$ E_{eq} = K_{E}\omega + iR_{a} + L_{a} \frac{di}{dt}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_{eq}=$ The equivilent emf across the circuit
>> $K_{E}=$ [[EMF constant (DC generator)|EMF constant]] 
>> $\omega=$ angular velocity
>> $i=$ current
>> $R_{a}=$ [[armature resistance]]  
>> $L_{a}=$ [[armature inductance]]

[[inductance]]
