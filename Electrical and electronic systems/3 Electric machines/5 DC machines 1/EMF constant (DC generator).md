>> where:
>> $K_{E}=$ [[EMF constant (DC generator)|EMF constant]]
>> $z=$ number of conductors
>> $D=$ gap between coils and magnets?!??!?!? (I hate unlabelled equations in slides reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) [[UNFINISHED STUFF]]
>> $B=$ [[tesla|magnetic flux density]]????
>> $L=$ length of conductor
>> $a=$ number of parallel paths
