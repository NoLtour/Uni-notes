#### What is a
## Transformer
A transformer comprises of two coils or windings wound around a laminated steel core (the core is laminated to reduce [[eddy currents]]). The winding connected to the source is known as the primary winding. The winding connected to the load is known as the secondary winding.

When the primary winding is connected to the source, magnetic flux will be generated. The flux will mostly flow through the steel core, which is an easier path to travel through compared to air, and will link with the secondary winding. If the source was AC, the flux will also be alternating and an emf will be generated in the secondary winding ([[faraday's law]]). Electric power will therefore be transmitted from the primary to the secondary via the magnetic field.

You can do some math [[wizardry]] to get from [[faraday's law]] to:

> ### $$ \frac{i_{2}}{i_{1}} = \frac{v_1}{v_{2}} = \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $i=$ current (AC)
>> $v=$ potential difference
>> $N=$ number of windings
