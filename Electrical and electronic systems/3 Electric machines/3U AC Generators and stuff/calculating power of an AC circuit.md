#### Whats the method for
## Calculating power of an AC circuit
Calculating power is easy for [[direct current|DC]] but the same method won't work for an [[alternating current|AC]] since the current is changing... so lets look at an example:

Given these two circuits:

The DC power is easy enough:
$$\begin{align*}
P &= IV
\end{align*}$$

For AC it's not as simple since the current and voltage constantly change, but if we have a sinasoidal AC wave then we can find the average magnitude of the height of the graph:

$$\begin{align*}
 &= 
\end{align*}$$
