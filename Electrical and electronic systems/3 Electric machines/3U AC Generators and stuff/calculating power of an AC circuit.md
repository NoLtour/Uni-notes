#### Whats the method for
## Calculating power of an AC circuit
Calculating power is easy for [[direct current|DC]] but the same method won't work for an [[alternating current|AC]] since the current is changing... so lets look at an example:

Given these two circuits:

The DC power is easy enough:
$$\begin{align*}
P &= IV
\end{align*}$$

For AC it's not as simple, if we use the equation $P=\frac{V^{2}}{R}$ to find instantanious power then integrate to find average power that will work: 
$$\begin{align*}
P_{Av} &= \frac{1}{T} \int^{T}_{0} 
\end{align*}$$
