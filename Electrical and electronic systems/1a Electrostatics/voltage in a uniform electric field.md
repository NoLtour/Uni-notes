#### What are the porperties of
## voltage in a uniform electric field

This is a uniform electric field, so between the plates the field strength is uniform.

>> $V=$ [[potential difference]]
>> $E=$ [[electric field]]
>> $d=$ distance between the plates

The [[potential difference]] between the plates creates what can be approximated as a uniform [[electric field]] between the plates, which leads to a constant force on charged particles inside this [[electric field]].

The force can be calculated using [[electric field#Equation|this equation]] rearranged into $F=EQ$.
