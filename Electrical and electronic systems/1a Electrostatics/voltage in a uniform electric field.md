#### What are the porperties of
## voltage in a uniform electric field

This is a uniform electric field, so between the plates the field strength is uniform.

The [[potential difference]] between the plates creates what can be approximated as a uniform [[electric field]] between the plates, which leads to a constant force on charged particles between
