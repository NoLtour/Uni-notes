#### What is
## coulombs law
> $$ F = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\cdot \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\epsilon_0 =$ [[permitivity of free space (electric)]] $\approx 8.85*10^{-12}$ 
>> $q_1=$ first charge
>> $q_2=$ second charge
>> $r=$ distance between charges
>> $F=$ repulsive force between charges

Alternative format:

> $$ F = k_e\cdot \dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $k_e =\approx 8.988*10^{9}$ 
>> $q_1=$ first charge
>> $q_2=$ second charge
>> $r=$ distance between charges
>> $F=$ repulsive force between charges
