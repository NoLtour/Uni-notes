#### What's
## Ohms law
> $$ V = IR $$ 
>> where:
>> $V=$ [[potential difference]] across component
>> $I=$ [[electric current|current]] across component
>> $R=$ [[resistance]] across component

This is fundamental to well, everything to do with electricity.
Ohms law exists because the resistance of a material that a current runs through leads to electrons "loosing energy" this creates a difference in potential across the object.

Ohms law assumes [[resistance]] to be constant, but in non-ohmic conductors this isn't the case, hence ohms law is only true for ohmic conductors.
