#### What are the
## Factors that effect resistivity
[[resistivity|Resistivity]] is unique for different materials but it can be effected by:
- Temperature - generally it increases with heat, but sometimes it will decrease

### Implications
#### Temperature
Filament  light bulbs heat up when running, so their [[resistivity]] increases and therefor their [[resistance]] increases, this increases the [[potential difference]] accross them.
