#### What are
## Capacitors
### General theory
Capacitors are electrical components that can store charge, by applieing a p.d accross them charge moves from one plate to another which resaults in an increasing opposing p.d till the capacitor is fully charged and the [[potential difference]] reaches a maximum.

The opposing p.d is a resault of the electric field while the driving p.d is a resault of the battery.

If the charging p.d is removed the capacitor discharges producing a current through the circuit.

Capacitors can be thought of as components that resist changes in [[potential difference|voltage]].

#### Equation
> ### $$ I(t) = \frac{dQ}{dt} = C \frac{d}{dt}V(t) $$ 
> ### $$ V(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int^{t}_{t_{0}} I(t) \cdot dt + V(t_{0}) = \frac{1}{C} \int^{t}_{-\infty} I(t) \cdot dt$$ 
>> where:
>> $I(t)=$ current as a function of time
>> $Q=$ charge
>> $t=$ time
>> $t_{0}=$ initial time
>> $V(t)=$ voltage as a function of time
>> $C=$ [[capacitance]]
