- The direction for current is alwayse clockwise, if the direction is wrong then we will just calculate a negative current value later
- We know [[Kirchov's voltage law]], so we sum voltage gains against voltage losses starting from the bottom left node in a loop. This gives $V - IR_1 - IR_2 - IR_3  =0$

### Voltage directions

- Mark the more positive side of each component with a plus
- Draw an arrow across the component representing the pd change across them, the arrow points away from the positive side.


### Example

Here the equation for the pds around loop 1 is: $-V_2+I_1R_1 -I_2R_2 = 0$
