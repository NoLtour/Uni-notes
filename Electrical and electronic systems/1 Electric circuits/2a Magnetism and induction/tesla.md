#### What's
## Tesla
This is the uinit of [[magnetic field]] strength.

It can be expressed mathamaticly according to the force excerted on a charged particle of one [[coulombs|coulomb]] moving perpendicularly through a magnetic field:

> $$ T = \frac{\phi}{m^{2}} = \frac{N}{Am^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $T=$ Tesla 
>> $\phi=$ [[magnetic flux]] (weber)
>> $m=$ meter
>> $N=$ Newton
>> $A=$ [[Electric current|amp]]

The force is due to the [[Lorentz's force law|lorentz force]]
