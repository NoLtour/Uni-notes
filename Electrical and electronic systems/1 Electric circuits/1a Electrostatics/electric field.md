#### What is a
## Electric field
These are the physical fields that surround electrically charged particles, they surround electrically charged particles and exert a force on all other charged particles in the field.

#### Equation

> $$ E = \frac{F}{q} $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ Electric field 
>> $F=$ Force
>> $Q=$ Coulomb

^d62c0b

Hence Electric field = force per unit charge.

You can represent electric fields with electric field lines, they go from the positive charge to the negative charge and intensity is represented by the line spacing, as you can see the lines become more spaced out as you travel away from the origin, representing the decreasing strength.
