#### What is
## The triboelectric effect
This is when two materials rub against eachother leading to the exchanging of charges, creating two [[static electricity|staticly charged]] objects.

The triboelectric effect can be dangerous for aircraft, while the aircraft travels through the air it rubs against dust, this leads to the exchanging of charges and then when the aircraft lands the [[static electricity]] needs to be discharged safely. If the [[static electricity]] isn't discharged safely it could discharge during refueling leading to an explosion.
