#### What is the
## Biot-savart law
This is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant [[Electric current]]. It relates the magnetic field to the:
- Magnitude
- Direction
- Length
- Proximity
Of the electric current.

Also note that this law only applies in magnetostatics (when the currents don't change with time), else use [[idk|¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]

The math for it is so [[Pasted image 20211027135126.png|easy!]]

> $$ B(\bar{r}) = \frac{I\mu_0}{4\pi} \int_C \dfrac{dl\cdot \bar{r}'}{|\bar{r}'|^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $B(r)=$ The resaultant [[magnetic field]] at position $r$
>> $\mu_0=$ [[permitivity of free space (magnetic)|vacuum permittivity]]
>> $dl=$ is a vector along the path $C$ whose magnitude is the length of the differential element if the wire in the direction of conventinal current 
>> $l=$ is a point on the path
>> $\bar{r}=$ is a position in 3D space
>> $I=$ [[Electric current|current]]

Ok so I was going to go through the proof but I have gone way too deep into this rabbit hole, uuh here's a thing:

All you need to know is [[biot-savart law]] causes:

Which then causes [[amperes force law|amperes law]], ok?
