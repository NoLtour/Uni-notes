#### What is
## Amp√®re's force law
(wow look at that fancy e!)
This is what we call the attraction/repulsion between two current carrting wires. 
The reason for this force is that each wire generates a magnetic field (due to the [[biot-savart law]]) and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a concenquence (due to the [[Lorentz's force law]]).
