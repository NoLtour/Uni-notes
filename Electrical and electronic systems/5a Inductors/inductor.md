#### What is an
## Inductor

This is a passive two terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when an electric current is flowing through it. An inductor is generally an insulated witre wound into a coil.

Inductors generally stabalise current, since they will take

### [[methath|Math]]

The [[magnetic flux]] in a coil can be found using:
> ### $$ N \varphi = Li $$ 
>> where:
>> $N=$ number of turns 
>> $\varphi=$ phase angle? (WHY DON'T PEOPLE LABEL EQUATIONS FFS)
>> $L=$ [[inductance]]
>> $i=$ current
Basically saying that the flux in a coil is proportional to the current flowing.
