#### What is an
## Inductor

This is a passive two terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when an electric current is flowing through it. An inductor is generally an insulated witre wound into a coil.

Inductors generally stabalise current, this is because the magnetic field created "matches" the current flowing through it. So to change the current you need to apply a pd accross the inductor; [[inductor#^52f189|the pd is proportional to the rate of change of current]]. This applys to both increaseing and decreasing the current.

### [[methath|Math]]

The [[magnetic flux]] in a coil can be found using:
> ### $$ N \varphi = Li $$ 
>> where:
>> $N=$ number of turns 
>> $\varphi=$ phase angle? (WHY DON'T PEOPLE LABEL EQUATIONS FFS)
>> $L=$ [[inductance]]
>> $i=$ current
Basically saying that the flux in a coil is proportional to the current flowing.

>> where:
>> $V=$ [[potential difference]] accross inductor
>> $L=$ Number of turns
>> $\frac{di}{dt}=$ rate of change of current

^52f189

### Example
>> Plot the voltage across the inductor vs time for the following circuit:
