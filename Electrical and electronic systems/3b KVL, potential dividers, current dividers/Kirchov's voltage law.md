#### What is
## Kirchov's voltage law
This states that the sum of [[potential difference]]s around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.

If you remember that potential difference is essentially just the difference in electron pressure between two points, then this law makes sense since if you make a full loop then the sum of electron pressure changes will be zero.
