#### What's the method for
## Simplifieing simple circuits
### Method
#### Requirements
- Must be represented in a way that it has 2 terminals
- Must only consist of resistors (that obey [[Ohms law]]), voltage sources and current sources

#### Theory
The method is based on the fact that any "black box" circuit that meets the above requirements can be represented as just a single voltage source and resistor in series:

#### Method
1) Identify the part of the circuit you are going to simplify
2) Find it's resistance between the two terminals
3) Find the [[potential difference|voltage]] across it

### Example

 1) > First we identify the circuit we want to simplify

> Which is baiscall everything except that resistor
