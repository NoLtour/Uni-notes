#### What's the method for
## Simplifieing simple circuits
### Method
#### Requirements
- Must be represented in a way that it has 2 terminals
- Must only consist of resistors (that obey [[Ohms law]]), voltage sources and current sources

#### Theory
The method is based on the fact that any "black box" circuit that meets the above requirements can be represented as just a single voltage source and resistor in series:
