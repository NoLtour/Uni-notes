# Stuff
### The based thing I am adding here is

![[BIG SHOT but it sounds like a chance to be a BIG SHOT!!.mp3#play]]

High amounts of based energy, it's easyer to guess where this is from. So the \[\[KROMER\]\] reward is lower:
- 0.1 \[\[KROMER\]\] - Where is it from
- 0.5 \[\[KROMER\]\] - Is it based?
