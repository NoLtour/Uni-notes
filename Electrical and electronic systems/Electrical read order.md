# Stuff
### The based thing I am adding here is

![[BIG SHOT but it sounds like a chance to be a BIG SHOT!!.mp3#play]]

High amounts of based energy. It's easyer to guess where this is from so the \[\[KROMER\]\] reward is lower:
- 0.1 \[\[KROMER\]\] - Where is it from?
- 0.5 \[\[KROMER\]\] - Is it based?
- 99 \[\[KROMER\]\] - If you knew where I got this version from I would honestly be really really supprised, if you do you get the \[\[KROMER\]\] jackpot, the link is \[\[HYPERLINK BLOCKED\]\]

There is honestly too much to write and research rn, like wtf. I'll finish these notes over christmass... probably.
