#### What is a
## N-p diode
#### Useful introduction
With all that shite from [[n-p junction]]s we can move onto using it as a [[diode]]! Lets go, refer back to [[n-p junction#^f31c74|why this is poggers]] also yes I did just use the word [[poggers]], you can [[cope]].

### Applying a [[potential difference]]
Before we begin to study in the following section how the diode can be utilised in a circuit, let’s observe what happens if we take our thermally stable p-n junction and apply a potential difference across its terminals.

With a [[potential difference]] first applied one way, then the opposite way, below you see the defining characteristic of a diode: the diode has a small resistance to current flow in one direction (forward bias) and a very high resistance to current flow in the other direction (reverse bias).

#### Reverse bias
The negatively-charged free electrons in the n-type material are attracted towards the more positive terminal of the supply, and the positively-charged holes in the p-type material are attracted towards the more negative terminal of the supply. Consequently, after a small transient movement of charge, current cannot flow due to the separation of electrons and holes. (However, the current isn’t exactly zero because of thermal effects of electrons jumping between [[valence and conduction bands]]).

#### Forward bias
In comparisan when in forward bias, with a supply voltage of opposite polarity. The free electrons drift in the opposite direction towards the more positive supply, and the holes drift towards the more negative supply. 
Holes and electrons meet in the depletion region were electrons from the n-type material ‘drop’ into the holes and continue drifting across the p-type material (or in other words, the holes in the p-type move towards the n-type material). Current is now allowed to flow. As can be seen, the depletion region still exists but is less wide than if the supply is either reversed or not connected at all.
