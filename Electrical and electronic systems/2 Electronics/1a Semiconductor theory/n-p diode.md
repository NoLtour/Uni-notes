#### What is a
## N-p diode
We already know the properties of a [[n-p junction]], how this effects current's that are put across it allows us to create a [[diode]]

This shows the energy bands in the p-type material now slightly raised above those in the n-type material. This is a consequence of the [[electric field]] (E) also shown. 
Negatively-charged electrons that attempt to migrate across the boundary from n-type to p-type conduction bands will need to migrate to significantly higher energy levels if they are not already in a higher energy state. (They are basically being repelled by the negative charge that has accumulated on the p-type side of the boundary and therefore only the most energetic will successfully cross to the p-type conduction band). 
Those electrons that ultimately combine with holes will subsequently give up some of their energy after crossing the boundary.

![[Depletion ]]
The main bulk of the diode 
remains neutrally charged (i.e. there are the correct number of electrons for all the 
atoms in the structure). However, there is a region indicated by the vertical dashes 
called the depletion region which spans a small distance either side of the boundary
