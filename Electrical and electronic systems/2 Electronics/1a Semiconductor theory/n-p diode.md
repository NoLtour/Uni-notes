#### What is a
## N-p diode
#### Useful introduction
With all that shite from [[n-p junction]]s we can move onto using it as a [[diode]]! Lets go, refer back to [[n-p junction#^f31c74|why this is poggers]] also yes I did just use the word [[poggers]], you can [[cope]].

### Applying a [[potential difference]]
Before we begin to study in the following section how the diode can be utilised in a circuit, let’s observe what happens if we take our thermally stable p-n junction and apply a potential difference across its terminals.

With a [[potential difference]] first applied one way, then the opposite way, below you see the defining characteristic of a diode: the diode has a small resistance to current flow in one direction (forward bias) and a very high resistance to current flow in the other direction (reverse bias).

#### Reverse bias
The negatively-charged free electrons in the n-type material are attracted towards the more positive terminal of the supply, and the positively-charged holes in the p-type material are attracted towards the more negative terminal of the supply. Consequently, after a small transient movement of charge, current cannot flow due to the separation of electrons and holes. (However, the current isn’t exactly zero because of thermal effects of electrons jumping between [[valence and conduction bands]]).

#### Forward bias
In comparisan when in forward bias, with a supply voltage of opposite polarity. The free electrons drift in the opposite direction towards the more positive supply, and the holes drift towards the more negative supply. 
Holes and electrons meet in the depletion region were electrons from the n-type material ‘drop’ into the holes and continue drifting across the p-type material (or in other words, the holes in the p-type move towards the n-type material). Current is now allowed to flow. As can be seen, the depletion region still exists but is less wide than if the supply is either reversed or not connected at all.

The effect of the [[electric field]] that exists across the [[depletion region]] needs to be considered. Given its direction, it opposes current in the forward bias, hence there is a ‘step’ in the potential across a [[diode]]. In the case of a silicon diode in forward bias, this is about 0.7 Volts and for a germanium diode about 0.3 Volts. (Diodes are mostly fabricated with silicon although germanium is also sometimes used.) This means that for a forward-biased silicon diode, our supply voltage needs to be at least about 0.7 Volts in order to produce current flow.

You can see that effect here, (it's all starting to come together {pog}).

(but what the fuck [[look at this stupid amount of notes]] I'm writing and I'm not even done, you can't blame me for just copying and pasting theirs then rewording it, it's sunday midnight and my weekend is a joke, hopefully next year students can use these, I mean they are just so much better formatted than the normal notes tbh)

### Use in circuits

You can see stuff, there is the reverse leakage current there too. Yeah, that exists (I want to [[go to sleep]], nope I'm drawing the line. Finishing this is a 'future me' problem, god I would hate to be that guy).
