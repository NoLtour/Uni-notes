#### What is a
## N-p diode
#### Useful introduction
With all that shite from [[n-p junction]]s we can move onto using it as a [[diode]]! Lets go, refer back to [[n-p junction#^f31c74|why this is poggers]] also yes I did just use the word [[poggers]], you can [[cope]].

### Applying a [[potential difference]]
Before we begin to study in the following section how the diode can be utilised in a circuit, letâ€™s observe what happens if we take our thermally stable p-n junction and apply a potential difference across its terminals.

With a [[potential difference]] first applied one way, then the opposite way, below you see the defining characteristic of a diode: the diode has a small resistance to current flow in one direction (forward bias) and a very high resistance to current flow in the other direction (reverse bias).
