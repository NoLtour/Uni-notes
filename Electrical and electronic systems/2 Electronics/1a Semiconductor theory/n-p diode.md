#### What is a
## N-p diode
We already know the properties of a [[n-p junction]], how this effects current's that are put across it allows us to create a [[diode]]

This shows the energy bands in the p-type material now slightly raised above those in the n-type material. This is a consequence of the [[electric field]] (E) also shown. 
Negatively-charged electrons that attempt to migrate across the boundary from n-type to p-type conduction bands will need to migrate to significantly higher energy levels if they are not already in a higher energy state. (They are basically being repelled by the negative charge that has accumulated on the p-type side of the boundary and therefore only the most energetic will successfully cross to the p-type conduction band). Those electrons that ultimately combine with holes as can be seen in Figure 1.4.2(a) subsequently give up some of their energy after crossing the boundary as described above.
