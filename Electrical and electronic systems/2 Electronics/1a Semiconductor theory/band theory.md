#### What is
## Band theory
### Electron shells
Electron distrobution of an atom can be described using it's [[electron configuration]], with low [[electron shell]]s being filled first.

The reason for electrons having to occupy different shells is explained using [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], as a consiquence electrons have discrete energy levels in atoms.

#### Consiquences in solids and formation of bands
Now you have a bunch of atoms packed close together and electrons begin to be shared between shells of adjasent atom's so the possibility of electrons overfilling electron shells exists, which is where [[band theory]] comes in.
Thing is molecules have this issue, when two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule the solution is each atomic orbital splitting into two [[molecular orbitals]] of different energy, this allows the electons in the former atom orbits to occupy the new structure without sharing the same energy.
In a solid where you have a huge number of atoms forming a [[Crystal Structures|crystal lattice]] you have the issue described above, so each atom also uses [[molecular orbitals]], each with a different energy (but very little energy differences between those in the same band). Since there are so many atom's on a macroscopic level we can appriximate these energy levels as continous bands.
The gaps between the bands are energy ranges that the [[molecular orbitals]] can't occupy and so are left empty.

### Band structure
As you can see, by increasing the space between atom's there are less shared shells, hence less [[molecular orbitals]] and so the bands shrink.

#### Types of band
In a solid you have the:
- [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]
- [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]]

### Implications for current
![[band theory and electric current]]

The position of these band's vary depending on if the material is a conductor or semiconductor.
