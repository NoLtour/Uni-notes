#### What is
## Band theory
### Electron shells
Electron distrobution of an atom can be described using it's [[electron configuration]], with low [[electron shell]]s being filled first.

The reason for electrons having to occupy different shells is explained using [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], as a consiquence electrons have discrete energy levels in atoms.

#### Consiquences in solids
Now you have a bunch of atoms packed close together and electrons begin to be shared between shells of adjasent atom's so the possibility of electrons overfilling electron shells exists, which is where [[band theory]] comes in.
Thing is molecules have this issue, when two atoms combine to form a diatomic molecule the solution is each atomic orbital splitting into two molecular orbitals of different energy, this allows the electons in the former atom orbits to occupy the new structure without sharing the same energy.
In a solid where you have a huge number of atoms forming a [[Crystal Structures|crystal lattice]]
