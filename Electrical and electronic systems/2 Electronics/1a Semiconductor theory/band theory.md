#### What is
## Band theory
### Electron shells
Electron distrobution of an atom can be described using it's [[electron configuration]], with low [[electron shell]]s being filled first.

The reason for electrons having to occupy different shells is explained using [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], as a consiquence electrons have discrete energy levels in atoms.

#### Consiquences in solids
Now you have a bunch of atoms packed close together and electrons begin to be shared between shells of adjasent atom's so the possibility of electrons overfilling electron shells exists, which is where [[band theory]] comes in.
