#### What is the
## Depletion region
### General definition

![[Pasted image 20211121230806.png]]
The main bulk of the diode remains neutrally charged. However, there is a region indicated by the vertical dashes called the [[depletion region]] which spans a small distance either side of the boundary between the [[doping semiconductors|p-type]] and [[doping semiconductors|n-type]] sides.

### Further info
The width of the depletion region is fixed once a thermal-equilibrium is reached because there is no longer a net migration of electrons. 
On the n-type side of the depletion region there are electrons missing so positive ions exist. On the p-type side of the depletion region electrons fill holes to produce negative ions. The depletion region becomes an important element in the discussions that follow regarding [[diode]]s because of its inherent [[potential difference]].
