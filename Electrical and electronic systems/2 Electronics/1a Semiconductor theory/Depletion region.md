#### What is the
## Depletion region

![[Pasted image 20211121230806.png]]
The main bulk of the diode remains neutrally charged. However, there is a region indicated by the vertical dashes called the [[depletion region]] which spans a small distance either side of the boundary between the [[doping semiconductors|p-type]] and [[doping semiconductors|n-type]] sides.

The width of the depletion region is fixed once a thermal-equilibrium is reached because there is no longer a net migration of electrons. On the n-type side of the depletion region there are electrons missing so positive ions exist. On the p-type side of the depletion region electrons fill holes to produce negative ions. The depletion region becomes an important element in the discussions that follow regarding diodes because of its ‘built-in’ potential difference.
