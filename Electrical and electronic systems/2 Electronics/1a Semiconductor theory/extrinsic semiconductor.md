### Extrinsic semiconductor
Semiconductors that [[band theory and electric current|produce current from the thermal excitement of electrons]] in a unpure semiconductor are known as [[extrinsic semiconductor]]s.

They can have [[majority charge carriers]] or [[minority charge carriers]] as the number of charge carriers in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] are not nesisaraly equal.

To create a extrinsic semiconductor we use [[doping semiconductors|doping]].
