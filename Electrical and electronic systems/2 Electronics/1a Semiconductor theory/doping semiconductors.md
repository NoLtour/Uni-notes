#### What's the reason for
## Doping semiconductors
### Introduction
We already know how semiconductors can conduct current from [[valence and conduction bands in conductors, insulators and semiconductors]].

Doping semiconductors involves adding impuritys to them to increase their charge carrier count to create an [[extrinsic semiconductor]].

#### Definitions
![[intrinsic semiconductor]]
![[extrinsic semiconductor]]

#### P-Type doping
This is where you produce an excess of electrons, so some will

#### N-Type doping
This is where you create an excess of holes in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]].
