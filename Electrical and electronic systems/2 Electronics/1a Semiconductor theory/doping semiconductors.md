#### What's the reason for
## Doping semiconductors
### Introduction
We already know how semiconductors can conduct current from [[valence and conduction bands in conductors, insulators and semiconductors]].

Doping semiconductors involves adding impurities to them to increase their charge carrier count to create an [[extrinsic semiconductor]].

#### Definitions
![[intrinsic semiconductor]]
![[extrinsic semiconductor]]

#### P-Type doping
This is where you produce an excess of electrons, so some will always be in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]].
Allowing electrons in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] to act as charge carryers.

#### N-Type doping
This is where you create an excess of electon holes in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]].
Allowing electons in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] to act  as charge carryers.
