#### Describe the structure of
## Valence and conduction bands in conductors, insulators and semiconductors
### Basic explenation
This image gives a general idea of the distrobutions of the electron capacitys at each energy level, as you can see the [[valence and conduction bands]] energy levels differ between materials.

### Conductors
As you can see for conductors the potential energy levels of electrons has a continous region that covers the [[fermi level]], this means that you will alwayse (above absolute zero) have some electrons in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]
