#### Describe the structure of
## Valence and conduction bands in conductors, insulators and semiconductors
### Basic explanation
This image gives a general idea of the distributions of the electron capacity at each energy level, as you can see the [[valence and conduction bands]] energy levels differ between materials.

### Conductors
As you can see for conductors the potential energy levels of electrons has a continuous region that covers the [[fermi level]], this means that you will always (above absolute zero) have some electrons in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] meaning that current's can easily be transfered through the material as the electrons can move through the material.

### Insulator
Insulators have a very large space between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] so to get electrons into the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] requires a very high [[potential difference]] across the material.

### Semi conductors
Semiconductors have a very small space between the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] and [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] meaning for a tiny [[potential difference]] there will not be enough energy to move an electron between these [[band theory|bands]] but a high enough [[potential difference]] can, meaning that you can
