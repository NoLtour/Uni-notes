### Intrinsic semiconductor
Semiconductors that [[band theory and electric current|produce current from the thermal excitement of electrons]] in a pure semiconductor are known as [[intrinsic semiconductor]]s.

They do not have [[majority charge carriers]] or [[minority charge carriers]] as the number of charge carriers in the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] are equal.
