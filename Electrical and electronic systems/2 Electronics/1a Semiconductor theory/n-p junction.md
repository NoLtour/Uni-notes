#### What is a
## N-p junction
### Intro
Looking back at [[doping semiconductors]], here's a big brain question: what happens if we slap a [[doping semiconductors|n-type]] and [[doping semiconductors|p-type]] doped semiconductor next to eachother? Will we get infinate energy, does the universe explode, [[does this happen]]?

Nah something much more intresting, we get an [[n-p junction]] (who could have seen that coming?!) it is clearly the best resault as this means that computers exist meaning that we get [[the internet]] and hence [[shiposting]].

### Important bits
#### Charge
Although the total charge is neutral, when the two materials make contact:
- The electrons near the boundary will diffuse from the higher concentration ([[doping semiconductors|n-type]]) to the lower concentration ([[doping semiconductors|p-type]])
- In a simular way the holes in the [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] will move from a high concentration ([[doping semiconductors|p-type]]) to the lower concentration ([[doping semiconductors|n-type]]).
-  The p-type semiconductor is now
