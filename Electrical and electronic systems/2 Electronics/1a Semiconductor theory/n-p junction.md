#### What is a
## N-p junction
Looking back at [[doping semiconductors]], here's a big brain question: what happens if we slap a [[doping semiconductors|n-type]] and [[doping semiconductors|p-type]] doped semiconductor next to eachother? Will we get infinate energy, does the universe explode, [[does this happen]]?

Nah something much more intresting, we get an [[n-p junction]] (who could have seen that coming?!) it is clearly the best resault as this means that computers exist meaning that we get [[the internet]] and hence [[shiposting]].
