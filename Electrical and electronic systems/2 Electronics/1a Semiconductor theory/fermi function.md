#### What is the
## Fermi function
The Fermi function f(E) gives the probability that a given available electron energy state will be occupied at a given temperature. The Fermi function comes from [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]].

> ### $$ f(E) = \dfrac{1}{e^{\frac{E-E_F}{k_BT}}+1} $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ Energy level (I think)
>> $E_F=$ [[fermi level]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
>> $k_B=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]

As you can see by the graph as temperature approaches abosulute zero the energy distobution of electrons becomes more and more uniform, this is around the [[fermi level]].
