#### What are
## Valence and conduction bands
These are the bands closest to the [[fermi level]], with:
- Conduction band being above the fermi level
- Valence band being below the fermi level

We know for electrons to move into the condution band they need to leave the valence band, leaving holes in that band. This can be seen using the [[fermi function]].
