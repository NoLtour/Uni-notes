#### Describe the connection between
## [[band theory|Band theory]] and [[Electric current|electric current]]
In order for a current to be produced within a material there must be the movement of charge carriers, in this case electrons.

For electrons to move they need to beable to move within the energy level they are at, so the band the electrons are in must have vacancies that they can move to so that they can move through the material. This is why there is different behaviour between the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] and the [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]]:
- [[valence and conduction bands|conduction band]] - There are lots of vacacies so electrons can easily move between the [[molecular orbitals]] of different atoms to move though the material
- [[valence and conduction bands|valence band]] - There can be
