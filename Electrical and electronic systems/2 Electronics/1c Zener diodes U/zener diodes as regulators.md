#### How can we use
## Zener diodes as regulators
![[Pasted image 20211219100304.png]]

If we think back to [[Kirchov's voltage law]], and how [[zener diodes]] have a maximum voltage they cannot exceed. Then $V_Z$ cannot exceed the max voltage across the [[zener diodes|zener diode]], making it very useful as a voltage regulator.
