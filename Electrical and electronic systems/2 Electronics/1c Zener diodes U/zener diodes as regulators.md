#### How can we use
## Zener diodes as regulators
![[Pasted image 20211219100304.png]]

If we think back to [[Kirchov's voltage law]], and how [[zener diodes]] have a maximum voltage they cannot exceed. Then $V_Z$ cannot exceed the max voltage across the [[zener diodes|zener diode]], making it very useful as a voltage regulator.

The resistor $R_S$ will regulate the current, which regulates the current for $R_L$ protecting it from excessive currents as well. We can easily calculate the value of $R_S$ for a particular required diode current and particular load current.
