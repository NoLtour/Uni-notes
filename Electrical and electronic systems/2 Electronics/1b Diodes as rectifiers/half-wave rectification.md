#### What is
## Half-wave rectification
This is basically where you slap a [[diode]] onto a AC source to ensure the current and voltage is desireable:

As you can see there is going to be a little 0.7V drop due to the diode, more importantly half of the voltage is lost since we block all voltage the moment it's negative. This is why the technical term for one of these devices is "the trash version of a [[full-wave rectification|FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!!!!]]"
