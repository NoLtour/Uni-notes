#### What is
## Smoothing and ripple reduction (circuit)
So if we look at [[full-wave rectification]] and [[half-wave rectification]] we can see that even though the voltage sign is constant the magnitude is constantly changing, even the glorious [[full-wave rectification|FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!!!!]] suffers from this problem, and yes I am leaving exclamation points mid sentence.
So we use [[smoothing and ripple reduction (circuit)]]
