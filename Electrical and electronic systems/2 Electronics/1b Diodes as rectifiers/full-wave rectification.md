#### What is
## Full-wave rectification
### FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER
This isn't some shitty [[half-wave rectification]] nah this is [[full-wave rectification]].

So this is inherintly much more efficient than [[half-wave rectification]] as you get double the wave (I'm no scientist but thats atleast 2x the wave!).
Basically look at that diagram, now think about what happens when you apply different voltages and how they interact with the [[diode]]s, hence
