#### Describe the function of a
## Diode source limiter circuit
If we look back at the [[single diode limiter circuit]], we can change the effective [[threashold voltage]] by modifieing the pd on the diodes loop:

>> where:
>> $V_{out}=$ Voltage output
>> $V_{dth}=$ diodes [[threashold voltage]]
>> $V_x=$ extra voltage source

The voltage source can of course be flipped to shift it the effective "threashold voltage" of tha branch in the opposite direction.
