#### What are
## Clamps
### Intro
A clamper is an electronic circuit that fixes either the positive or the negative peak excursions of a signal to a defined value by shifting its DC value.

A distinct feature of a clamper is the use of a [[Capacitors|capacitor]], this has useful effects on the circuit as it can only charge and once charged cannot discharge since that would require current flow in the opposite direction

In the same way that we used DC sources to shift the signal we can do that here:
