#### What are
## Zener diodes
### Intro
First of all [[hahaha wiener diode|funny]]. 

With that out of the way, lets get into it. Shockingly, this is actually a type of [[diode]].
If we look back at the [[n-p diode]], we know that if a voltage is applied in the reverse bias there is basically no voltage or current getting through; however a large enough voltage in the reverse bias can get through, diodes that are designed to be used in the reverse bias are called [[zener diodes]].

### Theory
