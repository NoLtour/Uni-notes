#### What is
## Guass's law (electric field)
This is a law relating the distrobution of electric charge to the resaulting electric field.
In it's integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary [[closed surface]] is proprotional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, independent of how that charge is distrobuted.
