#### What is the
## Biot-savart law
This is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant [[electric current]]. It relates the magnetic field to the:
- Magnitude
- Direction
- Length
- Proximity
Of the electric current.

Also note that this law only applies in magnetostatics (when the currents don't change with time), else use [[idk|¯\_(ツ)_/¯]]
