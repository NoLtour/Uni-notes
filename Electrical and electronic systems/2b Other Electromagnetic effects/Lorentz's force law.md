#### What is
## Lorentz's force law
This is the combination of an [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields which induces a force on the charge.
> $$ F = q(E + v\cdot B) $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ Force 
>> $E=$ [[electric field]] strength
>> $q=$ Particle charge
>> $v=$ Particle veclocity
>> $B=$ [[magnetic field]] strength
>> 
>> It should be noted that $E$ is measured perpendicular to $B$ (or vice versa), so you would break one down into a perpendicular component of the other when substituting into the equation.

Here we use conventional current (please read [[lmao|why we use conventional current]] for critical information)

This is also the left hand rule:
