#### What is
## Lorentz's force law
This is the combination of an [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields.

>> $F=$ Force 
>> $E=$ [[electric field]] strength
>> $q=$ Particle charge
>> $v=$ Particle veclocity
>> $B=$ [[magnetic field]] strength
>> 
>> It should be noted that $E$ is measured perpendicular to $B$ (or vice versa)
