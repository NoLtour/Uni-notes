#### What is
## electric current
It is the rate of flow of charge, and is measured in amperes:

> $$ I = \frac{dQ}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $I=$ current
>> $Q=$ charge ([[coulombs]])
>> $t=$ time (seconds)

The actual rate at which electrons move in a wire is incredibly slow (see: [[electron drift velocity#Calculating it]]) so the velocity of the electrons isn't what determins the rate at which electrisity propigates along a wire. The reason electrisity propigates so fast due to
