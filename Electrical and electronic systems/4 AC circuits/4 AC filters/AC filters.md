#### What are
## AC filters
### Intro
It is sometimes desirable to have circuits capable of selectively filtering one frequency or range of frequencies out of a mix of different frequencies in a circuit. A circuit designed to perform this frequency selection is called a filter circuit, or simply a filter.

If you think back to [[electrical impudance|impudance]] you'll remember that by using [[capacitors]] and [[inductor]]s you can get different resistances at different frequencies, a filter basically just exploits that fact to only let certain types of waveform through.

### General filter
Take the following circuit, where the section highlighted in blue represents the filter:

Usually you wouldn't show $Z_{out}$ instead showing it li
