#### How do we deal with
## Resistance in AC
### Equation
> ### $$ V = I_{p} \cos(\omega t + \phi) Z $$ 
>> where:
>> $V=$ potential difference across component
>> $I_{p}=$ peak current
>> $\omega=$ [[AC angular frequency]]
>> $Z=$ [[resistance in AC|impedance]]
>> $t=$ time
>> $\phi=$ time offset

[[resistance in AC|Impedance]] is the AC equivalent to DC resistance, it's basically resistance but waveform dependent. Hence when working with impedance you need to know the value for that specific waveform.

### Theory
For an ohmic resistor it's behaviour is completely defined using [[Ohms law]]:
![[Ohms law#^cfccff]]

When dealing with resistance current and voltage are in phase:

So basically you just combine the equation from [[Ohms law]] with [[complex numbers for representing AC]]. Although functionally similar to [[direct current|DC]] resistance, [[resistance in AC|impedance]] is waveform dependent, so it depends on frequency.
