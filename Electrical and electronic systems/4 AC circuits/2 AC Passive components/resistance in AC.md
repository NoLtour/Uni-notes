#### How do we deal with
## Resistance in AC
### Equation
#### Impedance component
> ### $$ Z_{R} = R + 0j = R $$ 
>> where:
>> $Z_{R}=$ [[resistance in AC|resistor impedance]]
>> $R=$ [[resistance]]
>> Component follows [[Ohms law]]

#### Standalone circuit
If you have a circuit where the only components are an AC source and a ohmic resistor:

Then since its impedance is $Z=Z_{R}=R$ it's voltage and  

### Theory
For an ohmic resistor it's behaviour is completely defined using [[Ohms law]]:
![[Ohms law#^cfccff]]

When dealing with resistance current and voltage are in phase:
