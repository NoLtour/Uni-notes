#### How do we deal with
## Resistance in AC
### Equation

### Theory
For an ohmic resistor it's behaviour is completely defined using [[Ohms law]]:
![[Ohms law#^cfccff]]

When dealing with resistance current and voltage are in phase:

So basically you just combine the equation from [[Ohms law]] with [[complex numbers for representing AC]]. Though for some stupid reason we call it impedance ($Z$) when working with [[phasor representation]] even though $Z=R+0i$ hence $Z=R$ but idk don't blame me for [[I might be wrong but if this is the case electronics is dumb|wasting your time]] with a 1 to 1 representation.
