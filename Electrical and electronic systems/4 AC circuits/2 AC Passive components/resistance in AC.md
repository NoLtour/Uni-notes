#### How do we deal with
## Resistance in AC
### Equation
> ### $$ Z_{R} = R + 0j = R $$ 
>> where:
>> $Z_{R}=$ [[resistance in AC|resistor impedance]]
>> $R=$ [[resistance]]

[[resistance in AC|Impedance]] is the AC equivalent to DC resistance, it's basically resistance but waveform dependent. Hence when working with impedance you need to know the value for that specific waveform.

### Theory
For an ohmic resistor it's behaviour is completely defined using [[Ohms law]]:
![[Ohms law#^cfccff]]

When dealing with resistance current and voltage are in phase:

So basically you just combine the equation from [[Ohms law]] with [[complex numbers for representing AC]]. Although functionally similar to [[direct current|DC]] resistance, [[resistance in AC|impedance]] is waveform dependent, so it depends on frequency.
