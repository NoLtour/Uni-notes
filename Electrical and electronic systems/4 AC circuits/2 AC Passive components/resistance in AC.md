#### How do we deal with
## Resistance in AC

### Theory
For an ohmic resistor it's behaviour is completely defined using [[Ohms law]]:
![[Ohms law#^cfccff]]

When dealing with resistance current and voltage are in phase:

So basically you just combine the equation from [[Ohms law]] with [[complex numbers for representing AC]]. Though for some stupid reason we can
