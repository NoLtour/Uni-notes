#### What is
## Impedance ($Z$)
This is essentially a blanket term for the relationship between current and voltage across some component in an [[alternating current|AC]] circuit. Impedance is the amount of resistance that a component offers to current flow at a specific frequency:

> ### $$ V = iZ $$
> ### $$ V = I_{p} \cos(\omega t + \phi)Z $$ 
>> where:
>> $i=$ instantaneous current
>> $V=$ potential difference across component
>> $I_{p}=$ peak current
>> $\omega=$ [[AC angular frequency]]
>> $Z=$ [[impedance]]
>> $t=$ time
>> $\phi=$ time offset

The impedance of a component is essentially an equation that represents how it interacts with AC at different frequencies:
> ### $$ Z = \sum\limits Z_{L} + \sum\limits Z_{R} + \sum\limits Z_{C} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Z=$  overall component [[impedance]]
>> $Z_L=$ [[inductance in AC#^ffad83|inductive reactance]]
>> $Z_R=$ [[resistance in AC#^40f307|resistor impedance]]
>> $Z_C=$
