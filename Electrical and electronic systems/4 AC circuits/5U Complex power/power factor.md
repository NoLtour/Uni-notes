#### What is
## Power factor
### Equation
Power factor is basically a measurement of real power relative to apparent power, hence power factors will alwayse be lower than 1.

> ### $$ PF = \frac{P}{|S|} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{P^{2} + Q^{2}}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $P=$ [[apparent, reactive and real power|real power]]
>> $Q=$ [[apparent, reactive and real power|reactive power]]
>> $|S|=$ [[apparent, reactive and real power|apparent power]]
>> $PF=$ Power factor

### Problems caused by it
Although people are charged according to [[apparent, reactive and real power|real power]], a lower power factor increases the current flowing in wires which increases losses due to that higher current. Also if the power factor is low enough (usually less than 0.85) then people may be charged additional fees due to the energy providers having to componsate in the grid for
