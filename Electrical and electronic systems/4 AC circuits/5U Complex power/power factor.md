#### What is
## Power factor
### Equation
Power factor is basically a measurement of what fraction

> ### $$ PF = \frac{P}{|S|} $$ 
>> where:
>> $P=$ [[apparent, reactive and real power|real power]]
>> $|S|=$ [[apparent, reactive and real power|apparent power]]
>> $PF=$ Power factor

### Problems caused by it
Although people are charged according to [[apparent, reactive and real power|real power]], a lower power factor (less than 1)
