#### What is the equation for
## Apparent, reactive and real power

### Complex power ($S$)

> ### $$ S = (V_{rms}\angle \theta) \times (I_{rms}\angle -\phi) = Im: v_{rms} \times i^{*}_{rms}$$ 
> ### $$ Q = Im: (V_{rms}\angle \theta) \times (I_{rms}\angle -\phi) $$ 
> ### $$ P = Re: (V_{rms}\angle \theta) \times (I_{rms}\angle -\phi) $$ 
> ### $$ S = P + jQ $$
>> where:
>> $I= (I_{rms}\sqrt{2}) \angle \phi$ 
>> $X^{*} = -X$ ([[complex co]])
>> $V= (V_{rms}\sqrt{2}) \angle \theta$ 
>> $P=$ real power
>> $Q=$ reactive power
>> $|S|=$ apparent power

### Real power ($P$)
Also known as "active" or "true" power, this is the actual amount of power in watts being dissipated by the circuit.

### Reactive power ($Q$)
The dissipated power resulting from inductive and capacitive loads measured in volt-amperes reactive.

### Apparent power ($|S|$)
The combination of reactive and true power measure in volt-amperes.
