### Complex power ($S$)

> ### $$ S = V \times (I) $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$

### True power
Also known as "active" or "real" power, this is the actual amount of power in watts being dissipated by the circuit.

### Reactive power
The dissipated power resulting from inductive and capacitive loads measured in volt-amperes reactive.

### Apparent power
The combination of reactive and true power measure in volt-amperes.
