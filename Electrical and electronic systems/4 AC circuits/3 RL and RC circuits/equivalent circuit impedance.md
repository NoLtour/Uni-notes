#### Expalin
## Equivalent circuit impedance
### Intro
Basically just like [[simplifieing simple circuits|Thevinins theorem]] (god I hate that name [[I do not know why I just hate saying it|so much]])

### Meath
#### Parallel
You can prove this quite easily so I'm not going to here, when working with multiple components in parallel you can basically just sum the [[impedance]] of each component in the same way you sum for [[resistors in parallel]]:
