#### What is
## Phasor representation
### Intro
It is not very convenient to handle equation or waveforms for alternating quantities. An alternating quantity (current or voltage) is a vector quantity. Since the instantaneous values are continuously changing, it must be represented by a rotating vector or phasor. A vector is a phasor that is rotating at a constant angular velocity. The image shows that sinusoidal voltage or current can be represented by a Phasor Representation diagram.

Phaser representation is just a fancy way of saying "we represent AC with a rotating vector":
