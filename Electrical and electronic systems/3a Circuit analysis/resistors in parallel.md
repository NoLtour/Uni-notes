#### How do you calculate the total resistance of
## Resistors in parallel
You can simplify circuits by modelling many components that are in parallel as a single component, to do this you can get their total resistance using this method.

$$ \frac{1}{R_T} =  \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} $$ 

The general form:
> $$ R_T = \sum\limits^{n}_{k=1} {R_k} $$ 
>> where:
>> $R_k=$ the resistance of a component 
>> $R_T=$ the total resistance across them
