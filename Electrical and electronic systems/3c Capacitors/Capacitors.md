#### What are
## Capacitors
### General theory
Capacitors are electrical components that can store charge, by applieing a p.d accross them charge moves from one plate to another which resaults in an increasing opposing p.d till the capacitor is fully charged and the [[potential difference]] reaches a maximum.

The opposing p.d is a resault of the electric field while the driving p.d is a resault of the battery.

If the charging p.d is removed the capacitor discharges producing a current through the circuit.
