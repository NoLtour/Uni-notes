#### What is the
## Mesh analysis method

### Method

1) Mark your diagram according to the [[ciruit analysis sign convention]]
2) Draw "loop currents" around each loop (these arn't real currents but help with analysis, at any given point the sum of adjacent loop currents will equal the real current)
3) Get equations according to [[Kirchov's voltage law]]

### Example
Find expressions for the resistances in this circuit:

1) First we mark the diagram according to [[ciruit analysis sign convention]]

2) Then we draw loop currents.

3) Now we can get equations:
> Loop 1
> $$ i_1 = I_1 $$
