- The direction for current is alwayse clockwise, if the direction is wrong then we will just calculate a negative current value later
- We know [[Kirchov's voltage law]], so we sum voltage gains against voltage losses starting from the bottom left node in a loop. This gives $V - IR_1 - IR_2 - IR_3  =0$
