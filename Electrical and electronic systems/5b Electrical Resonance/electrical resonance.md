#### What is
## Electrical resonance
Resonance is when the driving frequency is simular to the natural frequency of the system the amplitude increases, this can occur in circuits hence [[electrical resonance]].

This occurs in an electrical circuit at a particular resonance frequency, it is when the [[electrical impudance|impudances]] and [[admittance|admittances]] of a circuit cancel eachother out. ([[read this plz|important note on those linked terms]])

#### Circuit example:
Resonant circuits can generate very high voltages or currents, they can be created by connecting a [[inductor]] with a [[Capacitors|capacitor]].
