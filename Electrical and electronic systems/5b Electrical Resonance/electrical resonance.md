#### What is
## Electrical resonance
Resonance is when the driving frequency is simular to the natural frequency of the system the amplitude increases, this can occur in circuits hence [[electrical resonance]].

This occurs in an electrical circuit at a particular resonance frequency, it is when the [[electrical impudance|impudances]] and [[admittance|admittances]] of a circuit cancel eachother out. ([[read this plz|important note on those linked terms]])

#### Circuit example:
Resonant circuits can generate very high voltages or currents, they can be created by connecting a [[inductor]] with a [[Capacitors|capacitor]].

Lets  assume we start with a charged capacitor, now the capacitor applies a [[potential difference]] accross the inductor causing a current to flow. The discharging capacitor eventially reaches a state of no stored charge, but the inductor still has energy stored in its magnetic field, so the current continues flowing. Now the capacitor begins charging on the opposite side as teh inductor looses energy, and then the cycle repeats from the opposite side. This creates an [[alternating current]].
