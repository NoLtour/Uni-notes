#### What is
## Electrical reactance
Reactance is the opposition to alternating current presented by [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. 
A greater reactance in a component will give a smaller current for the same voltage accross it (I know this sounds like it's basically [[resistance]] and that's because it kind of is, but there is a bunch of important differences)
