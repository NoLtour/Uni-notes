#### What is
# UNFINISHED

## Electrical reactance
Reactance is the opposition to alternating current presented by [[inductance]] or [[capacitance]]. 
A greater reactance in a component will give a smaller current for the same voltage accross it (I know this sounds like it's basically [[resistance]] and that's because it kind of is, but there is a bunch of important differences)

What distinguishes reactance from resistance is:
- [[resistance]] causes electrical energy loss through heat
- [[electrical reactance|reactance]] dosn't lead to energy loss through heat, instead energy is stored and released a quater cycle later

### Capacitive reactance


### Inductive reactance
