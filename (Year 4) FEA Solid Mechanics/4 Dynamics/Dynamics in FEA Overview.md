# Dynamics in FEA Overview

#### Intro and contents
So far we have only considered statics problems, where we apply forces, moments or torques, and calculate deflections, and then strains and finally stresses. This fourth part of the module will show how we can apply the same principles to analyse dynamics, specifically free vibration. You might use this in design to avoid a structure from failing due to resonance.

- [[Hamiltons principle]]
- [[Hamiltons principle on a single DoF oscillator]]

We can apply this long method again for a two degree of freedom oscillator, but the point of this is to eventually do a short method. If you want that proof refer to [[Notes 04 Dynamics(3).pdf]].
