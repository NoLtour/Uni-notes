## Synchronous motion

Synchronous motion is when multiple objects or parts move together in time, matching each other's speed, direction, and rhythm. In mechanics and engineering, it means all parts move in perfect sync, usually to ensure smooth and efficient operation. For example, in a clock, gears move synchronously to keep accurate time, and in robotics, joints may move synchronously for precise control.
