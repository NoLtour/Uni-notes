## Principle of minimum total potential energy

The minimum total potential energy principle is a fundamental concept used in physics and engineering. It dictates that at low temperatures a structure or body shall deform or displace to a position that (locally) minimizes the total potential energy. Put in math form, we can find how a structure will be deformed using:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \Pi  &=  V + U \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \text{minimise } \Pi &&\to& &\text{find turning point to get minimum} &&\to& &\text{differentiation} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $U=$ Strain energy (The mechanical energy stored in the deformation of the structure)
>> $V=$ Potential energy (Instantaneous negative work done by external forces equation)
>> $\Pi=$ Total potential energy
