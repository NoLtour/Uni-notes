## Primary and secondary power system

### Intro

It is incredibly important to maintain a consistent power source, whether that be from batteries to smooth out demand/supply or a consistent source. This becomes especially important when you consider the importance of things such as thermal control systems, where black outs can lead to poor temperature management which could easily lead to catastrophic damage to components; other issues such as attitude control or loss of command can also lead to mission ending issues arising.

### Primary power system
The main source of electrical energy (i.e. for an earth orbiting satellite this is often the conversion of sunlight into electrical energy using a solar panel).

Other examples include:
- RTGs
- Fuel cells
- Batteries (in the event they aren't rechargeable)

### Secondary power system (rechargeable energy storage)
An electrical storage device, which implies the use of a battery, although other possibilities exist such as flywheels.
