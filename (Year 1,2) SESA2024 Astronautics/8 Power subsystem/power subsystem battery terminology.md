## Power subsystem battery terminology

Really basic but something to keep in mind:
- Arrays, [[primary and secondary power system|primary power system]] non rechargable.
- Batteries, [[primary and secondary power system|secondoary power system]] rechargeable.

When we talk about batteries we almost alwayse mean as [[primary and secondary power system|secondoary power systems]].
