## Power budget
### Definition
This is a breakdown of the power requirements over the course of a mission as well as additional safety margins to account for unexpected requirements. This acts as an outline of the baseline requirements for the course of a mission, to streamline the design process.
Often the power budget will also detail specific component power requirements.
