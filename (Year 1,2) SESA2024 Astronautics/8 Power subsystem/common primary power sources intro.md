## Common primary power sources

### Comparison

Depending on the duration and power output requirement the viable power source vary greatly.

(although nuclear reactors are shown they are really not viable in the current political environment)

### Bit more detail
#### Solar arrays

Typical power output in the region orbiting the earth is about ~100$W/m^2$ after considering the high inefficiency of most arrays. 
Of course since solar arrays require solar light, with the inverse square law once you get out to about saturn your looking at 100x less power, hence in the outer solar system solar panels are often not a suitable power source.

#### Fuel cells

Essentially chemical engines that produce electrical power with water as a by product. They are therefore particularly suitable for manned missions but the duration of their operation is limited (by the requirement to fuel the reaction with oxygen and hydrogen).

#### Batteries

Primary (unrechargeable) batteries are used for short duration missions, for example to power launch vehicles during the few minutes climb into orbit.

#### Solar dynamic devices
A solar concentrator, such as a parabolic mirror is used to focus the suns energy to heat a working fluid, i.e. water. The high pressure steam produced can then be used to drive a turbine generator. (More efficient than solar arrays but are generally much heavier)

#### Radioisotope Thermal Generators RTG

Typically an RTG that is 1m long and 30 cm in diameter will have a output of 200W and a weight of 40kg, since their power output is stable they are well suited for missions which cannot rely on solar panels and require (very very) long term energy generation.
It can be very difficult and expensive to get the radioactive material necessary for the production and usage of RTG's. Consider that even during manufacture and launch the RTG is constantly generating heat radiation and power.
They generate power by using a thermocouple (a device that generates power by a temp difference between two plates), the hot source is the radioactive isotope and the cold source is just the heat radiation off the dark side of a object in space.
