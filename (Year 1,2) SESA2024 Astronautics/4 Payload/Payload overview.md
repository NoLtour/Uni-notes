# Payload overview


There isn't actually much to say about the [[payload subsystem]] that hasn't been discussed already. The payload drives selection of everything else and kickstarts the process of balancing all the subsystems to get a final solution:

Something to keep in mind is the difference between repeating similar missions and science missions:
- Repeating missions such as communications and military missions can reuse design platforms more freely since the payload requirements are often similar to previous missions.
- Science missions are often unique and first of a kind offering very little reuse of old designs.
