## Payload subsystem
We call the payload the bit that fulfils mission objectives using a variety of sensors, communications hardware ect (the bit that preforms/measures the stuff you actually want once at the right location).

If your operation is [[you think I dont have a meme specifically about destroying france|blowing up Fr\*nce]], the payload is well "[[more anti french propaganda|the payload]]" (a [[I shall continue to slander frace for no particular reason|nuke]] :trol:).

The payload is supported by the [[spacecraft bus|bus]]. The payload is why the rocket exists and it is the starting point and primary driver of design requirements.
