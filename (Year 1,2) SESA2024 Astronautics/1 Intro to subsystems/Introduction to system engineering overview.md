# Introduction to system engineering overview

#### Intro and contents
Something that should be kept in mind is unlike other products such as cars and PCs which have many subsystems which are quite modular, the subsystems on a spacecraft are all extremely co-dependent so considerations on trade offs become very complicated.

Contents:
- [[essential spacecraft subsystems]]
- [[outline of stages of spacecraft design and development]]
- [[outline of design phases from European Cooperation for Space Standardisation]]
