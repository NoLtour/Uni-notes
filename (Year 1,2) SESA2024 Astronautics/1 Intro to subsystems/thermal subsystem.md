## Thermal subsystem
Provides the required temperature requirements for different parts of the spacecraft.

Typical operating values for common components are:

In space there is no such thing as maintenance, we've got to make completely self contained machines that can operate in a hostile environment for years. Each component will degrade much faster if not properly cooled/heated, so thermal control is especially difficult and important.

The payload of the craft can also be VERY demanding:
- Super high precision telescopes can be misaligned from thermal gradients
- Instruments requiring super cooling
- Instruments producing lots of heat
