## Orbital right ascension

### Right ascension

The orbital right of ascension of the ascending node is the angle between the [[first point of aries]] (a static([[I REALLY hate these measurement systems|ish]]) reference line) and the [[ascending node]]. We can see that the [[first point of aries]] is a static refrence as the planet orbits around the sun:

Then the [[ascending node]] describes the satellites orbit which remains static relative to the [[first point of aries]], hence the angle between these can be used as a constant which describes the position of the [[ascending node]]:

### Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (RAAN) ($\Omega$)

RAAN, is an orbital element used in celestial mechanics and astronomy. It specifies the angle between the vernal equinox and the point where an orbit crosses the celestial equator from south to north (ascending node). RAAN is measured in degrees and represents the orientation of an orbit in space.

In summary, Right Ascension (RA) is a coordinate system used to specify celestial objects' positions along the celestial equator, while the Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (RAAN) is an orbital element that defines the orientation of an orbit's ascending node with respect to the vernal equinox. RAAN is used to describe the orientation of celestial objects' orbits in space.
