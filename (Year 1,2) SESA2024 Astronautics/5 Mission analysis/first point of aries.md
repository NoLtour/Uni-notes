## First point of aries
The first point of Aries, also known as the cusp of Aries, is the location of the vernal equinox (March equinox), used as a reference point in celestial coordinate systems. In diagrams using such coordinate systems, it is often indicated with the symbol ♈︎. Named for the constellation of Aries, it is one of the two points on the celestial sphere at which the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic:

This is then useful as a reference point when trying to describe position within the solar system:
