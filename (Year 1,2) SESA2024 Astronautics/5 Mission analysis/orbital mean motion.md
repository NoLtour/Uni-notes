## Orbital mean motion ($n$)

If you look at the orbital period equation from [[keplers laws of orbital motion]]:
![[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8]]
You can see that taking $a$ and $\mu$ ($\mu=MG$) to be constant will give you $\tau$ equal to a constant, this clearly shows that the orbital period is the same for some [[ellipse|major axis]] regardless of [[ellipse|minor axis]]:

This is also the reason behind the definition of [[orbital mean motion]], that being the mean [[rigid body rotation around a fixed axis|angular speed]] required to complete one orbit:

> ## $$ n = \frac{2\pi}{\tau} $$ 
>> where:
>> $n=$ [[orbital mean motion]] (mean [[rigid body rotation around a fixed axis|angular speed]] required to complete one orbit)
>> $\tau=$ [[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8|orbital period]]
