## specific orbital [[moment of linear momentum|moment of momentum]] ($\vec{h}$)
The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]] of the relative position vector $\vec{r}$ and the relative velocity vector $\vec{V}$. (the orbital [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]] per unit mass)
 
> ## $$ \vec{h} = \vec{r} \times \vec{V}  = \vec{r} \times \dot{\vec{r}} $$ 
> ## $$ |\vec{h}|=h = r^{2}\dot{\theta} = \sqrt{\mu a (1-E^{2})} $$

Something very useful about this is that as the satellite orbits the value of $\vec{h}$ remains constant, it applies when the following conditions are met:
- No forces act on the body other than gravity
- Both objects can be treated as spherically symmetrical point masses
- The satellite has significantly less mass than the body it orbits

In a simple 2 body problem, this is a [[constant of motion]].
