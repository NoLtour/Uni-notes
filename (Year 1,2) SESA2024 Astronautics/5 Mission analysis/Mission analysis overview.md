# Mission analysis overview

#### Intro 
![[Pasted image 20221027233152.png]]
This guy figured out planets orbit in ellipses, then he made a telescope and put it in space which is how nasa started and the Kepler space telescope was created. ([[this is a completely true fact(s)|the end]])

#### Contents
KSP is unironically good introductory material.
