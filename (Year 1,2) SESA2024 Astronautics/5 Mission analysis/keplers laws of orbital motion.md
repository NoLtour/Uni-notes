## Kepler's laws of orbital motion

The laws are:
1) Planets orbit in [[ellipse (year 2)]]s.
2) Equal areas are swept in orbits in equal times.
3) The square of the period of the planet is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the Sun.

Since law 1 is [[it kinda is|obvious]] I'm only elaborating on 2 and 3. It is possible to easily prove them using the things from [[orbital path in ellipse form]], [[tangential and radial acceleration in orbital motion]] and [[specific orbital moment of momentum|specific orbital angular momentum]]; but since I'm lazy no.

### Kepler's 2nd law

> ## $$ \frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} r^{2} \dot{\theta} = \frac{1}{2} h $$ 
>> where:
>> $A=$ area swept by motion
>> $h=|h|=$ magnitude of [[specific orbital moment of momentum|specific orbital angular momentum]]

### Kepler's 3rd law

> ## $$ \tau = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^{3}}{\mu}} $$ 
> ## $$ \tau^{2} = a^{3} \frac{4\pi^{2}}{\mu} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\mu=GM$ 
>> $G=$ [[universal constant of gravitation|gravitational constant]]
>> $M=$ mass of body being orbited
>> $\tau=$ satellites orbital period
>> $a=$ satellite orbits [[ellipse (year 2)|semi-major axis]]
