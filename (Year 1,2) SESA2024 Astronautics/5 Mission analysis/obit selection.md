## Obit selection

### Low earth orbit (equatorial)
Often used for parking orbits.

### Low earth orbit (moderate [[orbital inclination|inclination]] ~50)
Space stations and communications.

### Low earth orbit (polar)
Earth observation, since orbital path passes over all points on earth.

### Highly eccentric orbit
Commonly used for communication, observation and other science missions.

### Semi-synchronous orbit
Commonly used for navigation.

### Geostationary orbit
Communications and observation, here the orbital period is ~24 hours (~35786 km). In reality it is 23h 54min 4 seconds, to account for travel around the sun.
