## Robot Operating System

From their website:
> ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open source software development kit for robotics applications. ROS offers a standard software platform to developers across industries that will carry them from research and prototyping all the way through to deployment and production.
> Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel. Create something new and do it faster and better by building on ROS!

That is to say, ROS offers libraries, tools, and a community-driven ecosystem, enabling rapid prototyping and reducing time to market for robotics products.  ROS accelerates robotics development by providing a common platform for research, prototyping, and production. It reduces development costs, enables cross-industry collaboration, and speeds up time to market, making it the go-to solution in fields such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and robotics for research and education.

There is [[Robot Operating System|ROS]] and [[Robot Operating System 2|ROS2]], we will be looking more at [[Robot Operating System 2|ROS2]] because well... it's better.
