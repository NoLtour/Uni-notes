## CMakeLists.txt

CMakeLists.txt is a configuration file used by [[CMake]], a popular cross-platform build system, to manage the build process for C++ (and other) projects.

CMakeLists.txt files provide essential instructions on how to compile, link, and organize [[software package|packages]] and their dependencies. CMake processes this file to generate platform-specific build scripts, such as Makefiles on Linux or project files for IDEs, enabling it to work across different operating systems.
