## Robot Operating System 2

ROS2 is the next generation of the [[Robot Operating System]], built to overcome limitations in the original ROS. It improves upon ROS by offering better support for real-time performance, multi-platform compatibility (including Windows and macOS), and more reliable communication through a modern system called DDS. 

ROS2 is designed to be more scalable, flexible, and secure, making it suitable for production-level applications, including those requiring high safety and reliability. It also supports embedded systems, making it more versatile across various robotic platforms.
