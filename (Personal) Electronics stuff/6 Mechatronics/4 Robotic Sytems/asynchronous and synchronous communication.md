## Asynchronous and synchronous communication

### Asynchronous Communication
Asynchronous communication refers to a method of communication where messages are sent without requiring the sender and receiver to be active at the same time. In this setup, the sender sends a message, and the receiver can read and respond at their convenience. Examples include email, messaging apps, and forum posts. Asynchronous communication is often used to handle tasks with varying response times and is well-suited for environments where immediate feedback is not necessary.

### Synchronous Communication
Synchronous communication requires both the sender and receiver to be engaged simultaneously, meaning messages are exchanged in real-time. This type of communication typically involves direct interaction, such as phone calls, video conferencing, or live chat. Synchronous communication is used when immediate feedback or real-time collaboration is needed.
