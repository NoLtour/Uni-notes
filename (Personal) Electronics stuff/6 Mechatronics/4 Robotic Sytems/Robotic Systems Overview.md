# Robotic Systems Overview

### Overview

We've broken all of ROS into everything needed to understand it, all aims are listed out in the lower sections. 

The notes pages themselves are:
- [[ROS Fundamentals Overview]]

## Fundamentals

- **Learn the purpose of ROS and ROS2**
  - Understand what ROS (Robot Operating System) is, why it is essential for robotics, and the key differences between ROS and ROS2.
  - Understand why ROS2 was developed, its improvements over ROS, and how it addresses shortcomings in ROS (e.g., real-time, multi-platform support, and DDS communication).

- **The architecture underpinning ROS and ROS2**
  - Learn the high-level architecture of ROS and ROS2 and what makes them effective for building robotic systems.
    - **Communication**: How ROS and ROS2 handle communication (ROS uses custom transport, ROS2 uses DDS).
    - **Platforms**: What platforms ROS and ROS2 can run on (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS for ROS2).
    - **Safety and real-time requirements**: Why ROS2 is more suitable for real-time and safety-critical applications.

- **What are packages, nodes, and workspaces**
  - Learn the basic components of ROS and ROS2:
    - **Packages**: What they are and how they organize ROS software.
    - **Nodes**: The smallest unit of execution within ROS, responsible for specific tasks (e.g., sensor data processing).
    - **Workspaces**: How they manage and compile packages.

- **What are topics, services, and actions**
  - Understand the communication mechanisms in ROS:
    - **Topics**: Publish/subscribe communication model for continuous data exchange.
    - **Services**: Request/response communication for synchronous tasks.
    - **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback.
## Intermediate

- **Message types and design**
  - Learn how messages are structured in ROS and ROS2 and how to create and use custom messages.
  - Understand built-in message types (e.g., `std_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`) and how to use them in your system.

- **Launch files and setting configurations**
  - Learn how to use launch files to start multiple nodes, configure parameters, and manage complex robotic systems.
  - Understand the structure and syntax of launch files, and how they work in ROS vs. ROS2.

- **Tools for visualization and debugging**
  - Get familiar with tools like:
    - **rqt**: GUI for monitoring topics, visualizing data, and debugging nodes.
    - **rviz**: Visualization tool for 3D robot models, sensor data, and environment.
    - **Gazebo**: Simulation environment to test robot behavior in a virtual world.
    - **CLI Tools**: `rosnode`, `rostopic`, `rosservice` (ROS) and `ros2 node`, `ros2 topic`, etc. (ROS2).
## Mastery

- **Understanding DDS in ROS2 and real-time capabilities**
  - Learn how ROS2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) for communication and how this improves scalability and real-time performance.
  - Understand the Quality of Service (QoS) settings and how to configure them for different communication needs (e.g., reliability, durability).

- **Robot Control and Navigation**
  - Dive into ROS control systems (`ros_control`, `control_toolbox`) and how they are used to control robot actuators (e.g., motors, arms).
  - Learn about robot navigation stacks for localization, mapping (SLAM), and path planning (e.g., `nav2` in ROS2).

- **Transformations (TF and TF2)**
  - Master coordinate frame transformations in ROS using the `tf` library (ROS) and `tf2` (ROS2) to track the relative positions of various robot parts and objects in the environment.

- **Real-time processing and multi-threading**
  - Explore real-time features in ROS2, like using the `RT_PREEMPT` kernel patch and configuring multi-threaded executors for high-performance applications.

- **Security in ROS2**
  - Learn about the security framework in ROS2 that includes authentication, encryption, and secure communication using DDS.
  
- **Multi-robot systems and swarm robotics**
  - Understand how ROS2 handles multi-robot communication and coordination using DDS and namespaces.
  - Learn how to implement swarm behavior, where multiple robots work together on a common task (e.g., autonomous delivery).

- **Behavior Trees in ROS2 (nav2)**
  - Learn how to implement modular, scalable behaviors using Behavior Trees for managing complex robotic tasks in ROS2, especially in autonomous navigation.

- **Advanced simulation and real-world robotics**
  - Master advanced simulation setups in Gazebo for testing, including complex environments, sensor simulations, and robot control.
  - Learn how to integrate real robots with ROS2 and test systems on hardware.
