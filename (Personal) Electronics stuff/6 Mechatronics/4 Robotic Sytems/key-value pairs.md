## Key-value pairs

A key-value pair is a basic data structure used to represent data in which each piece of information (the value) is associated with a unique identifier (the key). The key acts as an index or label for accessing the corresponding value.

For example:

``` YAML
name: Cirno
```

In this case, "name" is the key, and "[[Cirno]]" is the value. You can think of it like an entry in a dictionary, where the key is the word, and the value is its definition.
