## Software package

A software package is a collection of files and resources bundled together to provide specific functionality or a set of related functionalities in a software system. It typically includes the programâ€™s code (source or compiled), libraries, configuration files, and metadata. Packages are designed to be easily distributed, installed, and managed by package managers, which handle dependencies, updates, and versioning.

Software packages help in:
- Code Reusability: By encapsulating code for a specific purpose, it can be reused in multiple projects.
- Modularity: Packages promote a modular structure, allowing developers to use only the parts they need.
- Dependency Management: Packages can declare dependencies on other packages, simplifying complex software setups.

Examples of software packages include pip packages in Python, npm packages in JavaScript, and .deb packages in Debian-based Linux systems.
