## CMake

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform build system that manages the compilation and build process for software projects, especially those written in C, C++, and other compiled languages. It provides a way to write platform-independent build instructions that can be used across different operating systems, like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

CMake uses configuration files called [[CMakeLists.txt]] to describe how a project should be built. These files contain instructions on what source files to compile, where to find dependencies, how to link libraries, and where to place output files.
