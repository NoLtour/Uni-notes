## Manifest file

A manifest file is a metadata file that provides essential information about a [[software package]] or project. It describes the package's contents, dependencies, version, author details, and other relevant metadata. Manifest files are used by build systems, package managers, and other tools to understand how to compile, deploy, or interact with the package.

In general, a manifest file helps in:
- Dependency Management: Lists other packages or libraries required to run or build the software.
- Version Control: Specifies the version of the package, aiding in compatibility and updates.
- Configuration: Provides configuration settings that may influence how the software is built or executed.
- Documentation: Contains descriptive information like author, license, and summary, helping users and developers understand the package's purpose.

Examples include package.json for Node.js, pom.xml for Java/Maven, and [[ROS packages and workspaces#Package architecture|package.xml in ROS2]].
