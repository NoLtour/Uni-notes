## Effectively capturing customer requirements
### Surveys
Something that should be kept in mind is these can actually get quite expensive.

Language in a survey:
- Solution neutral and unbiased, for example: Discussing a method for moving cargo around between 2 points "The engine size must be more than 2 litres" is clearly biased towards combustion engines neutral language would be "Move cargo from A to B"
- Make use of customer terminology and language

The people targeted for a survey should include more than just the customer but all stake holders (operators, manufacturers ect).

### Ranking requirements
Surveys are great and all but the information's useless without a method for determining what requirements are most important, it is possible to rank these using simple things such as an arbitrary list but generally it's better to use other solutions such as a [[binary weighting matrix]].
