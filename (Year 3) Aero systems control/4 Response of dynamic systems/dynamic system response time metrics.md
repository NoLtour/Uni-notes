#### Peak time ($T_{p}$)

The time for the response to rise to the first peak.

#### Maximum overshoot ($PO$)

The maximum percentage of the response above the steady state value.

#### Settling time ($T_{s}$)

The time for the response to reach and stay within a range of the final value (e.g. 2%, 5%).
