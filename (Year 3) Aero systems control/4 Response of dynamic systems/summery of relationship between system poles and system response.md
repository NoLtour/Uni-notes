## Summery of relationship between system poles and system response

### Stability
#### Stable or unstable

The system is only stable of all [[system transfer function feature definitions|system poles]] lie to the left half of the s-plane.

#### Relative stability

The system's stability decreases the closer [[determination of system stability#Complex poles|phi]] ($\phi$) is to $90\degree$.

It also decreases with smaller [[transfer function variable names|system damping]] ($\zeta$).

### [[simple system response time metrics|Settling time]]

Time constant and settling time can be reduced by increasing the poles real part.

### Frequency

Resonant or damped natural frequency, equals the imaginary part of the pole positions.

### Undamped natural frequency ($\omega_{n}$)

equal to the distance of the poles from the origin. Moving poles further from the origin with constant $\phi$ or $\zeta$ reduces settling time, peak time and rise time while PO remains constant.

### Response speed

For a constant real part, improved by increasing the imaginary part until $\zeta$  is reduced to a permissible level, reducing peak and rise times.
