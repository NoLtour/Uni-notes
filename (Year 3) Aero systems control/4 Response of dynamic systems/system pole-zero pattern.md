## System pole-zero pattern

This is just a way of representing the [[system transfer function feature definitions|poles]] and [[system transfer function feature definitions|zeros]] of a system.

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{C}{R} = G(s) &= \frac{K(s+2)}{(s+1)(s+3)} = K\frac{s+2}{s^{2}+4s+3}
\end{align*}$$
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Poles:} \:s &= -1, -3 &&& \text{Zeros:}\: s &= -2
\end{align*}$$

For example the [[system pole-zero pattern]] of the system transfer function above is:

Breaking down this representation form:
- The [[system transfer function feature definitions|poles]] are represented with X's 
- The[[system transfer function feature definitions|zeros]] represented with O's
- There is both a real and imaginary axis, since $s$ may have imaginary components
