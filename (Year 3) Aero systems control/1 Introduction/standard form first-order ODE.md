## Standard form first-order ODE
 

> ### $$\begin{align*} \tau \frac{dy}{dt} + y  &= f(t)  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\tau=$ represents the time constant of the system
>> $y=$ is the [[dependent variables|dependent variable]]
>> $\frac{dy}{dt}=$  the rate of change of the dependent variable $y$ with respect to the independent variable $t$
>> $t=$ the [[independent variables|independent variable]]
>> $f(t)=$  forcing function
>
>> detail:
>> - $\tau$, a constant in this equation. It represents the time constant of the system. The time constant indicates how fast the system responds to changes in the input or disturbances. A smaller ττ means the system responds more quickly, while a larger ττ means a slower response.
>> - $f(t)$,  represents the forcing function or the input to the system. It is a function of time $t$, which influences the behaviour of the system. The presence of $f(t)$ means the system's response is influenced by an external input or disturbance.
