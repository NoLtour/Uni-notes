## Control response types

### Proportional control

 Proportional control is a type of feedback control system where the control action is directly proportional to the error signal. In simpler terms, the amount of correction applied is directly proportional to how far the system is from the desired or target state. This means if the error is larger, the correction applied is also larger, leading to a faster response. 
 
 However, proportional control alone cannot eliminate steady-state errors; it needs additional control strategies for precise regulation. This can be especially severe in complex systems.
