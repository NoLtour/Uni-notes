## Systems control defs

### Simple defs

##### System
An arrangement of components in such a manner as to form an entire unit.

##### Control system

A system where the components are connected so as to regulate itself or another system.

##### Input (excitation)

The stimulus or excitation applied to a control system.

##### Output (response)

The response from a system. Often the variable which is to be controlled.

##### Dynamic

A system where the output varies with time or is dependant on the past values of the input. A system which is not dynamic is said to be static.

### Example

This contains the previously defined features:
	- [[systems control defs|System]], the fly by wire setup
	- [[systems control defs|Control system]],  since it is setup to regulate itself it's obviously a [[systems control defs|control system]]
	- [[systems control defs|Input]], stick and computer
	- [[systems control defs|Output]], the aircrafts change in attitude and the feedback from the actuator

In summery: An electrical signal derived from the pilotâ€™s controls stick (or autopilot) drives a servo valve that is mechanically coupled to the elevator and thus determines its position
