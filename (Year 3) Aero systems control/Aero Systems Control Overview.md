# Aero Systems Control Overview

### Intro

Control can be defined as the operation of maintaining the state of a given system at a required point.

Control systems are required in many situations ranging from relatively simple applications such as maintaining the temperature in our homes or the speed of our cars through to more complex ones including full authority flight control, autonomous robots and intensive care facilities.

The reasons we want good control are countless:
- Reduce workload
- Perform tasks people canâ€™t
- Reduce the effect of disturbances
- Reduce the effect of plant variations
- Stabilise unstable systems
- Improve performance and/or efficiency
- Improve linearity
- Reduce operating cost

Good control is essential for basically everything, so in this module we learn how to do that using maths, logic and models ([[looking forward to calculus yaaay|poggers]]).
