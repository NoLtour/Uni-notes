## General control system

This is a generic representation of a control system, I've also provided a brief description of the real world meaning behind each component.

>> where:
>> $R=$ desired response - The target or goal for the system's output. It represents the desired behaviour or performance that the control system aims to achieve
>> $C=$ actual response - The observed or measured output of the system in response to external inputs and disturbances. It represents the actual behaviour of the system under the influence of the controller, actuator, and plant dynamics.
>> $E=$ error from desired response - The difference between the desired response ($R$) and the actual response ($C$).
>> $G_{c}=$ controller dynamics transfer function - The mathematical representation of the control algorithm or strategy that determines how the system should respond to deviations between the desired and actual outputs. The controller dynamics capture the behaviour of the control algorithm.
>> $G_{a}=$ actuator dynamics transfer function - The characteristics and behaviour of the physical actuator or device responsible for translating the control signal generated by the controller into a physical action or input to the system. It models the dynamics of the actuation mechanism.
>> $G_{p}=$ plant dynamics transfer function - The representation of the system being controlled, including its inherent dynamics and responses to inputs. The plant dynamics describe how the system reacts to control inputs and external disturbances.

The controller should also be able to maintain the output of the system is subject to disturbances, the form of the controller is dependent on:
- Characteristics of the system to be controlled (system response)
- Measured variables that are available ([[system observability|observability]])

If you can't observe an input, then you can't use a controller to respond to it!
