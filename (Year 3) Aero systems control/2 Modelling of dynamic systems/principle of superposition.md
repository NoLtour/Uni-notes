## Principle of superposition

The principle of superposition states that in linear systems, the total response to multiple inputs is equal to the sum of responses to each input acting alone.

Consequentially linear systems have:
1) Additivity, The response to a sum of inputs is equal to the sum of the responses to each individual input. Mathematically, for inputs $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{2}(t)$ and a system or equation $y(t)$, additivity can be expressed as: 
$$y(x_{1}(t) + x_{2}(t)) = y(x_{1}(t)) + y(x_{2}(t))$$
2) Homogeneity, Scaling the input scales the output proportionally. Mathematically, for an input $x(t)$ and a constant $A$, homogeneity can be expressed as:
$$ A\:y(x(t)) = y(A\:x(t)) $$

If an equation or system satisfies both these properties, it is linear. The principle of superposition essentially embodies these properties, stating that the total response of a linear system is the sum of responses caused by each individual input acting alone. This fundamental characteristic is used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and control systems, to analyze and solve problems involving linear systems.
