# Modelling of dynamic systems Overview

#### Intro and contents
Mathematical systems can be [[linear systems|linear]] or nonlinear and be [[time-variant system|time-variant]] of time-invariant. The reason we care is that linear systems are a solved issue, there are tones of tools for solving them analytically making dealing with them convenient. 
- [[linear systems]]
- [[time-variant system]]

Of course in real life some idealised [[linear systems|linear system]] doesn't exist, but often real life systems can be usefully approximated by them! Beyond the fact that responses are often only approximated (sometimes quite accurately) by proportional relationships, they also usually have limits of linearity:

Ok so there is clearly some method for [[linear approximation of nonlinear systems]] such as those seen in real life! Wait that created a link... oh neat.
