## Final value theorem

We often want to find the "final" value a system tends to, if we want to do so without leaving the laplace domain it's possible using the [[final value theorem]]:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \lim_{t\to\infty} f(t)  &=  \lim_{s\to0} sF(s) \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $f  =$ time domain functions
>> $F =$ Laplace domain functions

It is possible for the theorem to fail in the event that the limit doesn't exist. Which likely implies instability.
