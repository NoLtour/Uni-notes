## Gain and phase margin

> ### $$\begin{align*} GM  &= -M( \omega_{\phi=-180} ) \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \phi_{M}  &= \phi( \omega_{M=0} ) -- 180\degree \\&=  \phi( \omega_{M=0} ) + 180\degree  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $GM=$ Gain margin (given in $dB$), it is the negative [[linear system sinusoidal response|gain]] at the frequency that phase is $-180\degree$
>> $M(\omega)=$ [[linear system sinusoidal response|sinusoidal gain]] as a function of frequency
>> $\omega_{\phi=-180}=$ the frequency where the phase is $-180\degree$
>> $\phi_{M}=$ Phase margin, it is the [[linear system sinusoidal response|phase]] above $-180\degree$ at the frequency where gain is zero
>> $\omega_{M=0}=$ the frequency where gain is zero
>> $\phi(\omega)=$ [[linear system sinusoidal response|sinusoidal phase shift]] as a function of frequency
