## Other methods of trim

So far we've been modelling the tail plane using a elevator, but not all aircraft control the tail that way:

### Fixed tail

Benefits:
- Lighter
- Cheaper
- Simpler
- Often safer in event of failure

Cons:
- Limited control (can't move much)
- Higher associated trim drag

When modelling $a_{2}<a_{1}$.
