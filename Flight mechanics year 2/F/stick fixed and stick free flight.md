## Stick fixed and stick free flight

### Defs
Well the defenitions really ez, so the pilot has a stick (the control rod for the [[components of a tailplane|tailplane elevator]]):
- If he holds the stick in place it is [[stick fixed and stick free flight|stick fixed]] (he manually holds the elevator at a certain deflection)
- If he doesn't hold the stick it is [[stick fixed and stick free flight|stick free]] (the elevator will naturally go to it's equilibrium position)

### Consequences

#### Stick fixed
This can be quite easily described in math terms using the [[modelling the tailplane|tail hinge moment equation]]. [[stick fixed and stick free flight|Stick fixed]], $C_{M_{H}} \neq 0$ because it's equilibrium is being forced by pilot input:

- [[stick fixed and stick free flight|Stick free]], $C_{M_{H}}=0$ because the elevator is free to drift to equilibrium
