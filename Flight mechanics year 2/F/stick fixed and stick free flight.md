## Stick fixed and stick free flight

### Defs
Well the defenitions really ez, so the pilot has a stick (the control rod for the [[components of a tailplane|tailplane elevator]]):
- If he holds the stick in place it is [[stick fixed and stick free flight|stick fixed]] (he manually holds the elevator at a certain deflection)
- If he doesn't hold the stick it is [[stick fixed and stick free flight|stick free]] (the elevator will naturally go to it's equilibrium position)

### Consequences

#### Stick fixed
This can be quite easily described in math terms using the [[modelling the tailplane|tail hinge moment equation]]. [[stick fixed and stick free flight|Stick fixed]], $C_{M_{H}} \neq 0$ because it's equilibrium is being forced by pilot input:

We can also assume that $\beta=0$ because there is no point in the pilot using the trim tab if he is going to manually hold the elevator. Problem is controlling the tail like this is lots of effort on the pilots side so for thing's like cruse generally [[stick fixed and stick free flight|stick free]] is used instead.

### Stick free
In [[stick fixed and stick free flight|Stick free]], $C_{M_{H}}=0$ because the elevator is free to drift to equilibrium:

This will generally be used in cruse because then the pilot doesn't need to actively do shite, generally in these cases $\beta\neq 0$ but that isn't necessarily true. For the stick free case we can use [[modelling the tailplane#Hinge moment equation]] to figure out what's needed to reach this equilibrium.
