## Achieving trimmed flight

This was done in year 1 [[Basic aircraft trimming|trimmed flight]], but this is the year 2 [[shortened version of version|ver]] which has slightly different symbols used n stuff.

This diagram is the starting point, but we'll simplify it a lot using the following assumptions:
- Small angle of attack, so $T,D,D_{T},W\sin(\gamma)$ are all in the same axis
- Along that axis the forces balance $\sum\limits F_{x}=0$ or $T = D+D_{T} + W\sin \gamma$
- The tail plane is small and symmetrical such that the moment around it's quarter chord is zero $M_{T_{0}}=0$
- The moments caused by thrust, drag and tail drag are small relative to other moments such that they can be negated

Putting all that into a diagram:

Now we just need to find [[Basic aircraft trimming|trimmed flight]], aka $\sum\limits M=0$:
$$\begin{align*}
M_{0} + W\cos\gamma (h-h_{0})c &= l L_{T}
\end{align*}$$
