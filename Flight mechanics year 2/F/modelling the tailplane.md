## Modelling the tailplane

First note that for a tailplane it's AOA is different to the main wing AOA:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \alpha_{T}  &= \alpha + \alpha_{S}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\alpha_{T}=$ tail plane AOA
>> $\alpha=$ AOA
>> $\alpha_{S}=$ tail plane setting angle

But of course there is the effect of the main wings [[downwash for stability analysis|downwash]], here we represent (main wing) downwash angle with $\varepsilon$:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \alpha_{T_{eff}}  &= \alpha_{T} - \varepsilon - \varepsilon_{T}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\alpha_{T_{eff}}=$ 
>> $\alpha_{T}=$
>> $\varepsilon_{T}=$
>> $\varepsilon=$
