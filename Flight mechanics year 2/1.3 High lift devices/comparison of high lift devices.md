## Comparison of high lift devices

![[Pasted image 20230221135944.png]]

Typical values of airfoil maximum lift coefficient for various types of high-lift devices:
1) Plain airfoil
2) [[flaps|plain flap]]
3) [[flaps|split flap]]
4) [[slats|slat]]
5) [[flaps|single slotted flap]]
6) [[flaps|double-slotted flap]]
7) [[flaps|double-slotted flap]] with [[slats|slat]]
8) All the mechanisms with a suction mechanism on the top to delay seperation further

As you can see $C_{L}$ can get pretty high as increasingly extreme lifting mechanisms are used.
