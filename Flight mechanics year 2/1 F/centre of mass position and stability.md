## Centre of mass position and stability

![[Pasted image 20230215201944.png]]

Depending on the net moment changes whether the tail plane needs to produce an upwards or downwards force (kinda obvious), but this has some less obvious consequences:
- Forward CG position benefits stability (but results in poorer handling quality at low speed)
- Depending on CG position the tail planes camber may have to change
