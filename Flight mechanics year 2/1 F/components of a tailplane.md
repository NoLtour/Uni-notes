## Components of a tailplane

### General

Here there are 2 things you may not be familiar with:
- The trim tab
- The horn balance

### Horn balance

If you consider the forces acting on the tailplanes hinge, it's easy to imagine a strong force trying to straighten the elevator. The horn balance provides an opposite moment meaning there is less net force on the hinge, it is especially common/more pronounced on old planes where elevators where mechanically controlled so these forces were a bigger issue:

Within horn balances there are 2 category's, those with a shielded horn and those with an unshielded horn:

### Trim tab

This is a lil shit that lies on the end of the elevator, it can be deflected at a set angle to manipulate the behaviour of the tail without constant input from the pilot. It's to __TRIM__ the flight, get it __TRIMMING__ (it's jobs in the [[why am I being so agressive idk fuck you|fucking name]]).
