## Downwash for stability analysis

The average downwash from the front wing will obviously be some function of $C_{L}$. We know from [[Finite wing theory overview|finite wing theory]] that induced AOA for an elliptic wing is ([[elliptic lift distrobution analysis#^cbb7e1]]):

$$\begin{align*}
\alpha_{i} &= \frac{C_{L}}{\pi A}
\end{align*}$$

Then by slapping [[Oswald efficiency factor]] we can get
