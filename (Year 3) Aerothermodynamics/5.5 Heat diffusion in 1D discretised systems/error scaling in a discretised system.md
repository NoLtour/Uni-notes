## Error scaling in a discretised system


Error tends to decrease with smaller grid sizes ($\Delta x$), alternatively it can be significantly reduced by including higher order terms from [[Taylor series]] expansions.
- 1st order: error decreases by factor of 2 every doubling of grid size
- 2nd order: error decreases by factor of 4 every doubling of grid size
- 3rd order: error decreases by factor of 16 every doubling of grid size
- $n$th order: error decreases by factor of $2^{n}$ every doubling of grid size
