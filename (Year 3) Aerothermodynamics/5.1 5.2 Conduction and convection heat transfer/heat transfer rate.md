## Heat transfer rate

A convention note, $q$ does not necessarily mean [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|a specific property]], for heat it may actually mean heat transfer per area:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \dot{q}  &= \frac{\dot{Q}}{A}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\dot{q}=$ rate of heat transfer per unit area 
>> $\dot{Q}=$ rate of [[heat]] transfer
>> $A=$ area

When dealing with heat transfer problems, it is more likely to be the per area version rather than [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific]].
