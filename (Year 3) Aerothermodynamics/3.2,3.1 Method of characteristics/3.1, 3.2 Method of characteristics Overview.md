# 3.1, 3.2 Method of characteristics Overview

#### Intro and contents

Our end goal for this will be setting up all the tools we need for designing a supersonic nozzle:

So, let's do that.

3.1:
- [[irrotational, homentropic, supersonic flow]]
- [[Mach lines and domains of influence]]

3.2:
- [[method of characteristics]]

When working in a real flow field:

The method doesn't change, you just keep applying it in sequence down stream. Note that you need to solve them in order since at each interception $\mu$ changes because of the Mach change.

So far we've got the methods needed to calculate:
1) e, f, g
2) j, k
3) n

Next we cover reflections giving the tools for filling in the rest.
