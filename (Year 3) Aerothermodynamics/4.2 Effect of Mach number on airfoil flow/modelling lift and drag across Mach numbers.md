## Modelling lift and drag across Mach numbers

![[Pasted image 20231123190909.png]]

The effects of [[wave drag]] are devastating, but the adjustment's needed to include shocks using previous inviscid compressible flow equations can be difficult. 

In this module we look into 2 methods for including these effects to gain useful lift and drag predictions without the need for CFD:
- [[Prandtl-Glauert transformation]] - Used for $~M<0.8$
- [[Ackeret theory]] - Used for $~M>1.2$

The accuracy of these models can be seen plotted above.
