## Radiation issues in atmospheric entry and hypersonics

The influence of radiative cooling/heating is typically quite small, but in high temperature cases such as re-entry it can become quite a significant component.

But something to note is that "thing's glow when heated" also applies to gasses, so the boundary layer around a hypersonic object can get hot enough to glow. This has two effects:
- Transmitting that super hot temp onto the surface of the vehicle through radiation
- Transmitting that super hot temp away from the vehicle, dissipating energy

At about $10km/s$ the effect of radiative heating on the surface of the body becomes quite significant.
