## Gibbs free energy

In simple terms, Gibbs free energy reflects the balance between the energy of a system and the energy that can be used to do work. If ΔGΔG (change in Gibbs free energy) is negative, a process is spontaneous. If it's positive, the process is non-spontaneous, and if it's zero, the system is at equilibrium.

[[Gibbs' equation]] reflects this.
