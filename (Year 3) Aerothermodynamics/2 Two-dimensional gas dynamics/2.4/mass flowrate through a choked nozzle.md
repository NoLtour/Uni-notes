## Mass flowrate through a choked nozzle

As discussed, a [[converging diverging nozzles#Choked flow equation|choked flow]] through a [[converging diverging nozzles|converging diverging nozzle]] has quite predictable mass flow rate characteristics. It is not difficult to get the equation discussed there into the following form:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \dot{m}  &= p_{0}  A* \sqrt{\frac{\gamma}{RT_{0}}} \left(\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma+1}{2(\gamma-1)}} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\dot{m} =$ mass flow rate
>> $p_{0}=$ [[stagnation pressure]]
>> $T_{0}=$ [[stagnation points in a compressible flow|stagnation temp]]
>> $A*=$ throat area
>> $\gamma=$ [[specific heat ratio]]

Note that this equation can be applied so long as the [[stagnation pressure]] is constant, which means you can apply it along a single streamline that has only experienced [[isentropic process|isentropic processes]]. (For a idealised converging-diverging nozzle, this means so long as no shocks have occurred)
