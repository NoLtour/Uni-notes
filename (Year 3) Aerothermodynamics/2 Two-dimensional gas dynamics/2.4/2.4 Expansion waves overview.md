- [[oblique shocks|oblique shocks]]
- [[normal shock properties equations|normal shocks]]
- [[detached shock|detached shocks]]
- [[Mach reflection]]

At the end of the day, these are all forms of compression. But like in all flows supersonic flows need some mechanism for expansion. (look it's in the title you know what's [[no stop thinking that|coming]]).
