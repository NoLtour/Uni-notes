## Ludwig tube

![[Schematic-of-the-hypersonic-Ludwieg-tube-Braunschweig.png]]

This is a type of supersonic wind tunnel. It's operation is relatively "simple" but a disadvantage is it can only operate for about 100ms. The operation is as follows:
- A storage tube contains ultra high pressure gas, heating elements are used to ensure that as it expands the temperature can be maintained
- A diaphragm or high speed valve is used to release the gas, the test area is initially at low pressure or near vacuum
- The enters the Laval nozzle above Mach 1, it accelerates rapidly and enters the test section
- The flow front moves into the dump tank, it rapidly reaches the end creating all sorts of supersonic shockwaves which start propagating back up stream
- Once these shockwaves reach the test section, data collection ends hence the limited run time.
