## Wind tunnel flow visualisation

Both method's we're looking at make use of the density variation caused by flow changes, density influences light refraction allowing us to deduce density and therefor flow state.
- Shadowgraph - Here a parallel beam is shone through a test section directly onto a screen or camera, this results in an image representing the gradient of the density gradient (a double [[differentiation|derivative]]). 
- Schlieren - Similar to a shadowgraph, but a convex lens focuses the light onto a "knife cut off" which effects the light such that the projected image represents a density gradient (single derivative)

Generally we prefer the [[wind tunnel flow visualisation|Schlieren]] method as the data is simpler to manage.
