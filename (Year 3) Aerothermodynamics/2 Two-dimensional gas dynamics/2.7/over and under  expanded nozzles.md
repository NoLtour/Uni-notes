### Shocks

We really did go from [[quite literal when dealing with supersonic shite|0 to 100 in like a millisecond]]. Anyway, this isn't so bad, it just needs to approached one stage at a time.

#### Stages
##### 1 Compression

In the first section, the exit pressure is sub atmospheric by definition of an [[over and under  expanded nozzles]]. Hence for pressure equalisation a compressive shock must occur, this takes the form of:
- [[oblique shocks|Oblique shocks]] - This shock forms such that the resulting pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure across the [[Mach reflection|slip line]], it should be noted that the flow will still be supersonic across this shock. This then proceeds into another [[oblique shocks|oblique shock]] further increasing the pressure.
- [[normal shock properties equations|A normal shock]] - The streamlines through the "Mach disk" suggest that the angle allows for [[oblique shocks|oblique shock]] formation (it's in the bounds of the [[oblique shock chart]]), which means the normal shock formation is caused due to pressure. To reach a pressure as high as the double oblique shocks in the surrounding streamlines a normal shock is required. This also means the flow directly after the [[over and under  expanded nozzles|Mach disk]] is subsonic.

##### 2 Acceleration

What occurs next is really fucky, look at the streamlines. They actually form a [[converging diverging nozzles|converging diverging nozzle]], this causes the flow in the centre to potential reach the supersonic domain again. So once the flow starts expanding again it's supersonic but now lower than ambient pressure. 

##### 3 Expansion

Now the flow continues to expand, so expansion mechanisms take place, specifically [[Prandtlâ€“Meyer expansion fan|expansion fans]]. The fans form such that the [[Mach reflection|slip line]] (free jet boundary) matches atmospheric pressure. This essentially creates a diverging nozzle, accelerating the flow.

Then [[compression fans]] coalesce into a [[oblique shocks|oblique shock]] due to the pressure dropping too much. This causes #1 to repeat.

##### 4 The shock revolution and it's consequences

Every shock increases entropy, so the flow will have less useful energy through each shock diamond. This couples with other chaotic mechanisms (flow mixing and various reflected boundaries) till they fizzle out into the environment:

#### Without the Mach disk

The problem greatly simplifies in the event that no [[over and under  expanded nozzles|Mach disk]] forms:

Pretty similar since most of the underlying mechanisms are the same. The determining factor in wheter we get a Mach disk is todo

Mach disk is formed in response to creating high pressure

This is caused by oblique shocks
