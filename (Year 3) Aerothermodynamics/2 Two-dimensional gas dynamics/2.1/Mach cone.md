## Mach cone

Conceptually this is quite simple, the mach cone is simply the region in which a supersonic object can be heard. This becomes more obvious with examples.

Here as the source moves you get the dopler effect.

### Mach 1

Push it to the extreme and you get a front, beyond which the object can't be heard.

Push it even more extreme and a "cone" forms, beyond which you can't hear the incoming object... the [[Mach cone]].
