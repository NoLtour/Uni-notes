## Mach cone

### Mach triangle

The Mach triangle is a consequence of how information propagates through a supersonic flow, it describes various properties of a shock front interms of the shock front angle.

### Proof

Conceptually this is quite simple, the Mach cone is simply the region in which a supersonic object can be heard. This becomes more obvious with examples.

#### Subsonic

Here as the source moves you get the Doppler effect.

#### Mach 1

Push it to the extreme and you get a front, beyond which the object can't be heard.

#### Supersonic

Push it even more extreme and a "cone" forms, beyond which you can't hear the incoming object... the [[Mach cone]].

The relationship for Mach angle can be seen here.
