## Oblique shocks
### Description
You'd never guess what these are... they are [[normal shock properties equations|shocks]], but oblique ([[ok I will kill myself now|shocking]]).

In fluid dynamics, shock waves are abrupt changes in pressure, temperature, and density in a fluid. There are two main types: normal shocks and oblique shocks.

Unlike [[normal shock properties equations|normal shock]]s, oblique shocks, occur at an angle to the flow direction. They also slow down and redirect the flow, but unlike normal shocks, the flow remains supersonic (in most cases). Oblique shocks have shock angles of less than 90 degrees and are vital in aerodynamic applications where controlling supersonic flows without completely reducing their speed is necessary, such as in the design of supersonic nozzles and air intakes.

Note in this diagram the front shows [[oblique shocks]], those waves on the back are a different phenomena that we learn about later.
