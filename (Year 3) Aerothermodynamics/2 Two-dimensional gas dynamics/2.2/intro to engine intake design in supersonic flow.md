## Intro to engine intake design in supersonic flow

To some degree [[stagnation pressure]] can be thought of as a metric of useful energy in a fluid, using this we can get a sense of efficiency of a system by stagnation pressure losses.
Keeping that in mind lets consider converting supersonic to subsonic flow:
- For an oblique shock the larger the change in Mach number, the larger the stagnation pressure loss. 
- This effect follows a non-linear exponential-ish curve, in an idealised system we can increase efficiency by using many smaller oblique shocks rather than single large ones. 
- Of course in non-idealised systems such as those in real life, other trade offs would also take consideration leading to some optimal shock configuration rather than just adding more forever.

But fundamentally, we can see to increase engine efficiency we'll look to properly utilise many oblique shocks (as many as practical) before the normal shock.

Real world intakes get even more complex, just look at the Concordes:

If you really want to [[rocket science be like|suffer]], then consider 3D shock analysis, turbulent flow, mechanical complexity ect. It becomes clear rather quickly that although in an ideal system more shocks=better, real life is not ideal and we have to make hard choices.
