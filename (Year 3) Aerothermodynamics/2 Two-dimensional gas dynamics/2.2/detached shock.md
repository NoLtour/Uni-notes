## Detached shock
### Where it occurs
![[Pasted image 20231025103143.png]]

Looking at the [[oblique shock chart]], you can see that $\theta>\theta_{max}$ has no valid solutions. But obviously something must exist there, the shock phenomena that occurs in this range is known as a detached shock.

### Calculating angles

What makes these nasty is unlike [[normal shock properties equations|normal shocks]] or [[oblique shocks]] which have single angles they operate at, detached shocks form a curved surface meaning different [[oblique shock angles|turning angles]] across the entire surface leading to very [[it really is nasty|complex]] behaviour ($M_{2}$ varies across the whole surface).

>> where:
>> $a=$ flow inline with the tip, it is where the angle is $90\degree$ and is equivalent to a [[normal shock properties equations|normal shock]] 
>> $b=$ occurs between $a$ and $c$, here you'll find the maximum [[oblique shock angles|turning angle]] if comparing to a [[oblique shocks|oblique shock table]]
>> $c=$ this is the point on the surface where $M_{2}=1$, beyond which flow past the detached shock will be supersonic
>> $d=$ around here are [[oblique shock chart|weak solutions]]
>> $e=$ here a Mach wave occurs as you get really far from the object

As you can see, a rough idea of the behaviour of a [[detached shock]] can be understood by the chart for a [[oblique shocks|oblique shock]]:
- At the centre of the detached shock, you effectively have a single-point [[normal shock properties equations|normal shock]]
- Moving out you're still in the oblique shock tables strong solutions, and flow is subsonic
- Eventually you get into the weak solutions as angle increases
- Then you reach supersonic flow
- It slowly transitions back into freestream
