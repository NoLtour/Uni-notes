## Mach reflection

We looked at what occurs during a [[oblique shock reflection]], but what happens if the reflected "oblique shock" falls outside the range of possible $\theta$. Aka for the reflection $\theta>\theta_{max}$.

In this case we can get a Mach reflection.

Something to note is the $\theta$ condition to create a [[Mach reflection]] is identical to a [[detached shock]], further the behaviour is quite similar. The primary difference is that instead of the [[normal shock properties equations|normal shock]] region being a single point, like was the case with [[detached shock]]s, a [[Mach reflection]] has a tangible length where it is normal. This region occurs between the slip line and wall.

The slip line has some strange properties:
- Across it the pressure is continuous
- The velocities, temperature and density can be discontinuous

Also note that the intersection point, where all these phenomena intersect is T on the diagram and known as the [[Mach reflection|triple point]]. Note also that since across the Mach stem there is subsonic flow, information can back propagate so downstream conditions can effect it's shape and position.
