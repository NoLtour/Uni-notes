## Cost unit
A cost unit is any separately identifiable output for which a cost may be estimated or measured; since the output identified varies depending on activity ([[mmmm yes buisness studies|obviously]]) the exact definition of a cost unit varies greatly with industry for example:
- Aircraft manufacturing: each aeroplane would be a separate cost unit.
- Electronic components: each separate component, or each separate batch of a given component.
- Construction: each separate job.
- Hospital: “patient-day”.
- University: degree programme or course.

It is basically just cost per "something".
