#### What are the
## Factors that effect alloying
![[Pasted image 20211105155605.png]]

These factors effect how well a different atom can dissolve into a given material:
1) Atomic size - For [[substitutional atom]]s and [[interstitial atom]]s there cannot be a size difference between them and the main elements atom greater that 15%
2) Crystal structure - If both materials have simular structures then the impurity tends to be more soluble.
3) Electronegativity - If the difference here is too large you will get a chemical reaction instead. ([[duh idot|which is bad]])
4) [[valence|Valency]] - Metals more easily dissolve into others with higher [[valence|valency]].
