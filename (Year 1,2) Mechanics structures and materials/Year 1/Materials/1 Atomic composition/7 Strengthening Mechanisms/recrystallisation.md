#### What is
## Recrystallisation
This is the process in which grains of a crystal structure come in a new struceture or new crystal shape. 
It often is used to replace deformed grains with a new set of defect free grains. This occurs by new grains [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleating]] and growing using material from the origional grains, until the origional grains been completely consumed.
This process usually reduces the strength and hardness of a material making it more [[ductility|ductile]].
