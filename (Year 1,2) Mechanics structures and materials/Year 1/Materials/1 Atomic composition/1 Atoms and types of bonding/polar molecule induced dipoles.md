#### What are
## Polar molecule induced dipoles
These are when molecules become polarized for one of multiple reasons:
- the [[van der waals force]] leads to electron concentration
- [[covalent bonding|covalent bonding]] leads to electrons concentrating on one side of a molecule, leading to a polarized molecule.
Once polarized they will excert their own [[van der waals force]] on surrounding particles.
