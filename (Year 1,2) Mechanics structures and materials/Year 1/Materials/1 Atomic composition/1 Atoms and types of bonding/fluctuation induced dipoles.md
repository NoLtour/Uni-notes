#### What are
## Fluctuation induced dipoles
These are when atoms become [[polarised atoms]] and excert [[van der waals force]] on nearby atoms. 

[[nonpolarized atoms|Nonpolarized atoms]] can become [[polarised atoms]] as a consiquence of the random position of their electrons over time, just due to random chance sometimes more electrons are concentrated on one side of the atom polerising it.

Fluctuation induced dipoles can dissipate back into normal [[nonpolarized atoms]] due to electron diffusion.

It should also be noted that the concequential [[van der waals force]] excerted on nearby atoms leads to the creation [[polar molecule induced dipoles]].
