- [[thermosetting polymers|Thermoset]]s are generally very brittle but quite strong.
- [[thermoplastic|Thermoplastic]]s have resonable strength, combined with their large plastic region gives them good impact resistance properties,
- [[elastomers|Elastomers]] can be stretched to incredibly long lengths but are quite weak.
