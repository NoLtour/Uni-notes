#### Define
## Fatigue life ([[material fatigue]]) ($N_f$)
The number of cycles to cause [[final fracture (material fatigue)|final fracture]] at a specified [[stress amplitude]].

This is basically the thing we care about for a given material, as it directly effects the reliability of the material/compnent lifespan.

#### Meth
Fatigue life is a measure of the total cycles needed before final fracture to occur during [[material fatigue]].

> ### $$ N_f = N_i + N_p $$ 
>> where:
>> $N_f=$ [[final fracture (material fatigue)|fatigue life]]
>> $N_i=$ [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]]
>> $N_p=$ [[crack propagation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack propagation]]

Since final fracture occurs so rapidly, it doesn't contribute to the number of cycles before fracture enough to be of any note.
