#### What is a
## Cathode
A cathode is the electrode from which a [[conventional current]] leaves a polarized electrical device. A conventional current describes the direction in which positive charges move. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to that of the conventional current flow.
TLDR: the cathode is the part that gains electrons, it has a positive charge.
