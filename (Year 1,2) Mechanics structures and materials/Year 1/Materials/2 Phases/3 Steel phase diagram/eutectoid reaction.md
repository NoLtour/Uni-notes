#### What is a
## Eutectoid reaction
Note all diagrams here are using [[steel phase diagram|steel]] as the example.

### What it looks like
This is like a eutectic reaction interms of the [[phase diagram basics|phase diagram]] location and the structure it forms:

### Why it occurs
It occurs because the temperature is too low for the substance to remain dissolved so you get [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] at grain boundaries. If we use the example of [[steel phase diagram|steel]]:

The lameller structure minimises the diffusion distance for the carbon atoms creating the structure.

[[Nucleation (crystal)|Nulcleation]] occurs at the grain boundary because they contain many vacancies making them energetically favourable to start at, the high temperature also helps this diffusion occur.
