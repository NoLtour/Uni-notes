#### How can we model
## [[shear strain]] in a circular beam (torsion)

### Equation

> ### $$ \gamma = \frac{R\theta}{L} = \tan \varphi $$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ radius of beam 
>> $\theta=$ Rotation between ends (radians)
>> $L=$ Length of beam
>> $\varphi=$ look at diagram

### Proof

If we look back at [[basic properties of circular shafts under torsion]], we can see how the beam changes shape under rotation:

By focusing on a small section (represented in red) we can see that there is a shear force. To simplify the diagram lets get a 2D representation of this:

We can find sheer stain:

$$\begin{align*}
strain &= \frac{extention}{orig\:len}\\
\therefore \gamma &= \frac{R\theta}{L} = \tan \varphi
\end{align*}$$
