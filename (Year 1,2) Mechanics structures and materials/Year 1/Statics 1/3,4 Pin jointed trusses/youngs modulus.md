#### What is
## Youngs modulus
Youngs modulus is the property that measures the stiffness of a solid when a force is applied along it.

> $$ E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$  Youngs modulus
>> $\sigma=$ [[Stress]]
>> $\epsilon=$ [[Strain]]

further:

> $$ E = \frac{F/A}{\Delta l/l_0} =\frac{Fl_0}{A\Delta l}$$
