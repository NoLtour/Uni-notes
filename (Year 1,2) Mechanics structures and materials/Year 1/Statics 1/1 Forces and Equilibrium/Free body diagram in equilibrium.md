#### What are the properties of a 
## Free body diagram in equilibrium

For a [[Free body diagram|FBD]] to be in equilibrium, the resaultant external forces and moments are zero.

> $$ \vec{F}_{res} = \sum\limits{\vec{F}} = \vec{0} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\vec{F}_{res} =$ The resaultant force in a given direction
>> $\vec{F} =$ any force acting on the body in a given direction

### Method

For a 2D object you would find the horizontal and verticle components of each force and sum them, if the horizontal and verticle resaultant forces are zero then the objects in equilibrium, you will also need to check if moments are zero. (for objects with more dimentions, figure it out idot)
