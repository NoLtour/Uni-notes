#### What is
## Hydrostatic stress ($\sigma_{H}$)
So basically take the [[generalised hookes law]] equations and assume that $\sigma_{xx}=\sigma_{yy}=\sigma_{zz}$ (stress is equal in all directions), now take the [[volumetric strain]] equation and sub it in, do some math wizardry and get:

> ### $$ \varepsilon_{V} = \frac{3(1-2\nu)}{E}\sigma_{H} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{xx}=\sigma_{yy}=\sigma_{zz}=\sigma_{H}$ 
>> $\sigma_{H}=$ [[hydrostatic stress]]
>> $E=$ [[Youngs modulus]]
>> $\nu=$ [[poisson's ratio]]

Note that sometimes the [[bulk modulus]] is used:

> ### $$ \varepsilon_{V} = \frac{\sigma_{H}}{K} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{xx}=\sigma_{yy}=\sigma_{zz}=\sigma_{H}$ 
>> $\sigma_{H}=$ [[hydrostatic stress]]
>> $K=$ [[bulk modulus]]

As you can probably guess by the name "hydrostatic" this is and how this is applied to situations of uniform stress, we often use it in conjunction with [[Hydrostatic force notes|hydrostatic stuff]], like submeged small things.
