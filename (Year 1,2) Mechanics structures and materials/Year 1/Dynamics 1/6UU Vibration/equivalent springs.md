#### What are some
## Equivalent springs
### List
Many things can be modelled as springs using the equation $F=kx$ but the equation defining $k$ varies depending on what we are modelling. So here are a bunch:
- [[equivilant spring for a rod under axial load]]
- [[equivilant spring for a cantilever bean under transverse load]]
- [[equivilant spring for a simply supported beam]]
- [[equivilant spring for a beam with both ends fixed]]
- [[equivilant spring for a beam with single end fixed]]
- [[equivilant spring for a solid in shear]]
- [[equivilant spring for a shaft in torsion]]
- [[equivilant spring for a helical spring under axial load]]
- [[equivilant spring for a air spring]]
