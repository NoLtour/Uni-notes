#### Why do we consider
## Inertial frame of reference
So far basically all our calculations involving movement have been taken from the frame of reference of the surface of the earth, hears a real shocker in rocket science: [[big brain moment|that's often not the case]]. Velocitys change depeding apon where they are measured from, in both magnitude and direction so we need to keep that in mind.

Defining an inertial frame is actually somewhat difficult, but it can be thought of as some "absolute" frame of reference that everything moves relative to and [[Newtons second law]] applies.
- On earth this would be the earth
- Inside a train at constant speed, would be the train 
- In space it would [[lmao idk|be]]
