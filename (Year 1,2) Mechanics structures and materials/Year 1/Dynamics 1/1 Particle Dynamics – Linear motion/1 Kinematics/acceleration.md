#### Define mathamatically
## Acceleration
We already have [[Speed, velocity and acceleration]], but heres some more:

> ### $$ \bar{a} = \frac{d\bar{v}}{dt} = \bar{v} \frac{d\bar{v}}{d\bar{s}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{a}=$ [[acceleration]] as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] 
>> $\bar{v}=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]] as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $\bar{s}=$ poition as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $t=$ time

Note that this will also work if you are using scalar equivilents.
