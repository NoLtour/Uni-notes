#### What is the general method for
## Using integration to relate velocity, acceleration and position
### Intro
If we look back at the definitions for [[acceleration]] and [[velocity and speed|velocity]]:

![[acceleration#^f3760f]]

![[velocity and speed#^2bea63]]

Basically this just uses [[integration]] to relate the things above...

### Example
Given you have a function that defines [[velocity and speed|velocity]] interms of displacement, find time:

$$\begin{align*}
v(s) &= \frac{ds}{dt}\\
 dt&= \frac{1}{v(s)} ds\\
\int 1 \cdot dt&= \int \frac{1}{v(s)} \cdot ds 
\end{align*}$$

So these can be figured out quite easily tbh.

### Standard Resaults
