#### What is
## Conservation of momentum
In a [[closed system]] the total momentum remains constant. This applies to all interactions between particles:

> ### $$ \sum\limits \underline{I_{1}} = \sum\limits \underline{I_{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{I_{1}}=$ the inititial momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]]
>> $\underline{I_{2}}=$ the momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]] at some time
>> Note that these are vectors, that is important!

(The lecturer said it doesn't hold for collisions with the ground, which is wrong the ground does accelerate, it's just negligible and is canceled out by the forces needed for your origional acceleration (usually gravity). I know he knows that statement was wrong, but it [[reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|irritates me anyway]]...)
