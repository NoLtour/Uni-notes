### Surface treatments
Effect of surface treatments (using chemical reactions on the surface of the material):
- [[anodising]]
- [[carburising]]
- [[nitriding]]

### Coating
This is glorified painting, less cool than surface treatments. Though of course it is much more variable in what can be achieved.
