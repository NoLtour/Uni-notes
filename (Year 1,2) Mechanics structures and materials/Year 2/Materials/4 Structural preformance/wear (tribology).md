## Wear

You may be thinking "wtf is [[tribology]]", well there you go.

Here wear describes failure mechanism that are based on the effect of surface properties and rubbing. (shocking)

The shocking consequences of wear are:
- Loss of fit (though it might also lead to better fit in some cases)
- Fatigue (real shock here, it creates crack what do you expect?)
- Seizure (caused by loss of fit)

### Abrasion
Rough surfaces rubbing against each other, or hard particles ploughing their way through your nice component:

### Complex loading

### Adhesive wear

So you know how cold welding is a thing that exists (generally in a vacuum), well on a small scale it can also occur between two in atmosphere surfaces also. Thing is, especially when dealing with rough surfaces they will not lead to a strong "tiny weld" which will break when under load leading to a ripping effect:
