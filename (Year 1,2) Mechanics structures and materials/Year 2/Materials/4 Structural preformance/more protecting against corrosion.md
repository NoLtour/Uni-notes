## More protecting against corrosion (Year 2)

Basically a continuation of [[protecting against corrosion (year 1)|protecting against corrosion]] (year 1).

#### Summary

### Sealing

Ok so here's some big brain thinking, if oxides are formed during corrosion because [[oxidation reaction|oxidation]] is occuring... why not remove the oxygen? We call this revolutionary process sealing:

Of course any trapped oxygen that was in there once you sealed it up may still be used and cause a lil corrosion, but beyond this preliminary corrosion there won't be any further. 

Sealing is only useful if the oxygen is actually causing the corrosion (which is often the case especially when working with metal.)
