## Microscopic defects

(insert defenition here)

An example would be all the defects in a shit connection such as a weld:

Tones of microscopic defects:
- Cavitys between the weld and material
- Cracks in both
- Tiny defects caused by the rapid temp changes
- Impurities leading to gaps which become cracks
- Oxidised material creating issues

The fact that welds don't just crumble into dust is a miracle.
