## Contributions for fatigue

### Factors effecting fatigue strength
There are 5 main ones:
- Macroscopic stress concentrations, think geometry of the structure: narrowings, corners ect.
- Microscopic stress concentrations, [[precipitation (crystals)|precipitation]], cracks, defects.
- [[residual stress|Residual stress]]
- Environmental factors

If your thinking "but you only listed 4", well.... THERE ARE ONLY 4 ON THE SLIDE EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS 5. You will share in the [[having lasted this long on the course we are both quite experienced|mental pain]] this is giving me.

### Example

This is a turbine blade in some modelling software, notice the red. The red is bad (science). This is macroscopic concentration, at the same time there is also microscopic stress concentrations due to the way the alloy cooled which lead to slightly non uniform material properties and microscopic deformities. This little shit called a stringer exists as a micorscopic defect which acts as a initiation point for cracks:

Just trying to get you to consider that all of these factors will act on the material simultaneously, and you want to make sure the regions most negatively effected don't overlap (think a weld spot which generally has the worst of all effects taking place).
