## Localised corrosion

So there is [[uniform attack (corrosion)|uniform corrosion]], which is annoying but generally easy(er) to observe and manage... then there is localised corrosion, this is evil. Localised corrosion can be 100000x faster faster than uniform corrosion. A common cause of localised corrosion is the relative size of the anode and cathode, since the [[cathode]] controls the reaction rate. If the cathode is larger than the anode then corrosion is going to be highly concentrated on the small anode leading to concentrated corrosion and horrible things like [[pitting (corrosion)|pitting]].
