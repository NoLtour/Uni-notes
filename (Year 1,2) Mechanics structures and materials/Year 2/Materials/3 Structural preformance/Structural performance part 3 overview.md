# Structural performance part 3 overview

#### Intro and contents
Corrosion is a bitch, it causes billions worth of damage on a yearly basis and you need some understanding of electrochemisty to properly understand it... which is the point of this stuff:
- [[electrochemistry of corrosion]]
- [[corrosion rate]]
- [[concentration polarization (corrosion)|polarisation]]
- [[passivation]]
- [[electro potential and passivation]]
- [[types of corrosion]]
- [[cavitation]]
- [[localised corrosion]]
- [[galvanic corrosion]]
