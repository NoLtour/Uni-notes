## Electro potential and passivation (UNFINISHED AND CONFUSED)

The protective layer in [[passivation]] may not necessarily form depending on the [[cathodic reaction]] that can occur given the electro potential across the material.

So this is my understanding of it:
- In the passive state the electro potential is in the goldilocks zone where the oxide layer is thin and provide protection that prevents further oxidation, since no chemical reactions are occurring it's passive. If the layer is damaged the reaction will occur on the damage repairing the layer.
- In the transpassive state you've got too high an electro potential and the oxide layer no longer prevents further oxidation (I think this is because at this point the oxide layer actually becomes soluble?), either way the outcomes basically going to just be [[corrosion]].
- In the active state the oxide layer doesn't form and you just have the metal dissolving into the solution, essentially just being a [[sacrificial anode]].
