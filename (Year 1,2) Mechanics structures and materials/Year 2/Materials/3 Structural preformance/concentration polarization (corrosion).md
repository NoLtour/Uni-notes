## Concentration polarization (corrosion) (ALL UNFINISHED)
### The mechanism behined it
Concentration polarization of an electrode is the result of the formation of a diffusion layer adjacent to the surface of the electrode where there is a gradient of ion concentration. 
Diffusion of the ions through the layers controls the electrochemical reaction and is important for processes such as electroplating and corrosion. 
Concentration polarization may be reduced by increasing agitation or raising the temperature of the electrolyte.

When considering the physical location of ions you can start to understand polarisation. For example polarisation at the cathode shown above, the hydrogen ions get depleated near the cathode since they react to form hydrogen gas which bubbles off. This results in a higher concentration gradient which will lead to a higher electro potential ([[electrolyte concentration effect on electro potential|Nernst equation]]) and hence faster corrosion. This can also occur at the anode.

The increased electropotential due to the formation of a depletion zone is known as a [[concentration polarization (corrosion)|overpotential]].

Here $i$ is the current density.

NOTE: in the notes this is not specifically called concentration polarization, which is [[can you tell the lack of detail in the materials notes is irritating me|dumb]] because it is. They should use the correct terms reeeeeeeee.
