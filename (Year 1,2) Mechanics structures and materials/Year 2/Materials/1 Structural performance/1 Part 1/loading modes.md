## Loading modes

### Description

There are 3 loading modes when considering a crack tip, these are referred to as:
- Mode I, opening, this is where the stress is acting to pull open the crack. This is the worst loading mode for an equivilent stress.
- Mode II, shearing, this is where shear acts along the crack.
- Mode III, twisting (also known as antishear), this is where twisting acts to twist the crack. (least common failure mode)

When brittle failure occurs it'll happen along the path that experiences the maximum opening stress. So it will be due to a mode 1 failure.

Recall that yield is just [[dislocation motion]], which requires a shear stress (mode II), so yield only occurs when a shear stress is involved.

In real life loading conditions it is likely that multiple loading modes will be occurring on a crack simultaneously.

### Real life implications

Here the entire tube is under torsion, the direction of the cut then means that the crack experiences type II loading:

If you take the same loading conditions and create a 45 degree cut instead of a straight one the loading mode changes:

Now there is Mode 1 loading, you can imagine that as the angle of the cut changes relative to torsion the combination of multiple loading modes change too! Now consider that materials will have an absolute shit tone of tiny defects going in all different directions the material only needs a single defect to experience excessive loading for the whole thing to fail!

### How this links to failure

Now consider a brittle rod under torsion, it has lots of tiny defects in it in many orientations. Some will therefore be at 45 degrees and experience the terrible Mode 1 loading! Since it's brittle the cracks can't reorientate themselfs into a lower stress state and so you get brittle failure at 45 degree angles along these opening loads:

Consider the same loading conditions but where the rod is ductile, as the crack opens it is reoriented so that it is no longer causing a mode I loading. So slowly all your cracks will start to align at 90 degrees to the rod axis, the main mode will now be mode II. This leads to a right angled flat torsion failure as it get's sheared apart:
