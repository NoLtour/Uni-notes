## Striations

![[Pasted image 20230207000036.png]]

These look like [[beach marks]], and are kinda related but different. Notice the magnification, this is from an electron microscope... which is [[of course I can see these with my naked eye because I have no skill issue|slightly higher]] magnification than beach marks which are often observed with the naked eye...

The point here is they small, so small infact that they pretty much show the lifetime propagation of the crack. If you zoom in near the cracks origin they will have a different separation to if you observe further away. The math is complicated but the take away is with smart maths and smart computers we can do some magic and use the seperation of these striations to estimate crack growth rate as the crack progressed! Which gives lots more insight into the failure!

People always hate on materials but honestly some of the content and crack forensics is fucking [[maaaaaaaaaaaaaaagic|wizardry]].
