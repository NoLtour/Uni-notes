## Shear centre

This is some point on the cross section where an applied shear load will not result in any twist.  The location where [[calculating shear stress in open sections|shear flow]]s cancel will be the location of the shear centre, in the case of symmetrical sections the shear centre will lie on the axis of symmetry:

In the case of simple cross sections then the shear centre often lies at the intercept between bits:

In more complex cases where it is may not be so simple:
