## Skin

This is the outer surface which is directly exposed to aerodynamic effects:
- It must withstand the normal and tangential forces acting on the surface ([[Form and pressure drag notes|eg pressure and skin drag]])
- It must retain it's aerodynamic shape and be smooth
- Withstand shear and deformation under wing bending
- Withstand a high degree of cyclic loading
- Resists buckling

Aircraft skin experiences a wide variety of loading conditions depending on it's location and aircraft attitude.
