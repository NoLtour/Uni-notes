## Stringer / Stiffener

### Role

These are spanwise members which are attached to the [[skin]].

The wing skin can also be integrally stiffened which means that the stringers are effectively an integral part of the skin, which is generally formed by machining.

The role of stringers is to carry tensile and compressive loads which arise in wing bending. More particularly, they act to stabilise the skin against buckling when it is subjected to a compressive load. They achieve this by dividing the skin into relatively narrow "strips" which have an increased buckling load. 

As the stringers are fairly long,  they will themselves buckle unless they are supported at frequent intervals. This is one of the roles of the wing [[ribs|ribs]].
