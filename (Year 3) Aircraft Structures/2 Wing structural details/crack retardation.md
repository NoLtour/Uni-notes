## Crack retardation
Yoooooo, [[on crack and retarded|literally me]].

Although the structure is designed so that no fatigue crack should start in the normal operating life of the aircraft, or "safe life" of a component, some cracks are bound to occur due to inadvertent manufacturing defects or damage and scratches caused in service.
The structure is designed so that if such cracks do occur, they will not spread catastrophically before they would be discovered in inspections of the whole structure. To slow down the spreading of such fatigue
cracks, "crack retarders" or "crack stoppers" are used.

### Panel attachment

When connecting wing components, care needs to be made to avoid [[stress concentration]]:

This type of adjustment to how sections connect can be seen in modern wing design.

### Crack stopper

Here a crack stopper is a separate strip of material bonded to the surface of a [[spar]]:
- When a crack approaches it the increased material area reduces the load, impeding crack growth
- The separation of the materials makes it difficult for the crack to propagate into the stopper
- The crack stopper effectively holds the material together

Note that [[stringer|stringers]] can act as crack stoppers.

Crack stoppers can be found in many structures, here a fail safe strap is attached to the fuselage:
