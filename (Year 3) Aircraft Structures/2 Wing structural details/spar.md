## Spar

Generally they take on a form seen in I and C beams:

These run spanwise throughout the wing. They carry vertical shear forces acting on the wing and also form part of the wing torsion box. Wing spars in modern aircraft are machined from thick plates of aluminium alloy and have flanges or booms at the top and bottom edges.

- carry the direct bending stresses due to the wing bending moments
- they help attach the skins to the spar web
- form part of [[torsion box]]

Frame truss spar is terrible and rarely used.
