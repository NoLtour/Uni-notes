## Delamination
Delamination is very common in composites, here the interlayer adhesion fails causing separation between layers, delamination can take the form of slow propagation over many loading cycles or rapid failure.

Delamination is mostly caused by out of plane tension forces or shearing in plane with the composites desired loading plane. Hence in cases of compression, buckling easily causes delamination.

Much like pushing on the ends of a deck of cards, the entire stack can come apart under compressive loads.
