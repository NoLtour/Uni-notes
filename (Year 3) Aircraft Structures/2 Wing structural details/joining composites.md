## Joining composites


In aircraft structures composites are generally stiffer than metals, so from an engineering standpoint, the composite carries most of the loads. To compensate for this additional stress, manufacturers must build up the joint with more material, a process that adds weight to the aircraft. Moreover, the metal will expand and contract much more than the composites to which it is joined, an imbalance that can cause joint failure. 

The solution seems simple enough: use more composites. Joining composite to composite eliminates some of the issues but they can cause others. For example, joining of composites is often done with an adhesive layer that is prone to [[delamination]] under certain types of loads. Using fasteners to join composites presents other difficulties due to the stress concentrations from drilled holes and thermal expansion mismatch between the composites and the fasteners. Ideally, designers are looking to create more integral composite structures that do not require joining.
