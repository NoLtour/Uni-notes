## Isotropic material properties

Isotropic materials have uniform properties in all directions. This means that their mechanical and thermal characteristics, such as strength and conductivity, remain consistent, regardless of the direction in which they are measured.

Often [[isotropic material properties|isotropic]] materials are contrasted against [[anisotropic material properties|anisotropic]] materials. Generally in the comparison of metals and [[composites]].
