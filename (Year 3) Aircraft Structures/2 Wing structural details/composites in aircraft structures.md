## Composites in aircraft structures

### Advantages

- Composites offer a very high stiffness–to–weight ratio. Very stiff fibers (usually carbon or glass) are embedded in a matrix (usually some sort of plastic). The fibers provide the stiffness, and the matrix provides the glue to produce a stiff structure that is very light. 
-  Since composites are composed of a matrix reinforced with a fiber, it’s rare for large cracks to develop in them. Small cracks ordinarily stop when they run into a stiff, neighboring fiber. When extreme forces are applied to the structure, composites indeed may crack, but the energy required for complete fracture is significant. 
- Metals are susceptible to both fatigue and corrosion. Aircraft operate in very corrosive environments, and inspections for corrosion damage are carried out often. Composites don’t corrode and they are also not subject to fatigue damage to the extent of metal structures. (Superior cyclic load capabilities, which is the primary cause of fatigue damage)
- Another passenger benefit to composites is that due to their very stiff material properties, windows can be larger. 
- Non-isentropic stiffness means we can only offer structure maximum stiffness where it is needed. 
- Composites can be tailored to slightly change shape in designed ways with an applied load, which allows designers to create more aerodynamically efficient wing structures. ([[aeroelastic tailoring]])
- With composites, engineers also are more easily able to embed sensors into the aircraft’s skin to allow pilots to watch for any damage. 

### Disadvantages


- Since composites are often constructed of different ply layers into a laminate structure, they can "[[delamination|delaminate]]" between layers where they are weaker. Out–of–plane loads perpendicular to the layers are one cause of [[delamination]], so designers have to be aware of all of the potential loads paths in the structure to avoid this. 
- Similarly, any loads that try to compress the length of the fibers can cause [[delamination]]. 
- The internal load distribution in a composite can be very complex, which can cause layers to separate in certain combinations of loads. This isn't a common issue with metal structures.
- The complexity leads to increased uncertainty in calculations, resulting in higher [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]]s, reducing the benefits of light weighting
- Composites cannot be inspected for weakness or internal damage in the same way that metals can. Delamination and cracks in the composite matrix are usually internal to the composite and will not be visible from the surface. Techniques are available to find such faults but they require a different methodology than that to which the industry is accustomed.
