## Ribs

![[Pasted image 20240227182810.png]]

These are structural components in the wing which hold the aircrafts skin in the correct aerodynamic shape:
- Transfer aerodynamic forces from the skin into the [[spar|spars]]
- Carry shear force, bending moments, in-plane tension and compression
- Provide support for [[longeron|stringers]]

Like what was seen in [[spar#Types]] these can be machined or built up. Of course machined parts are generally better but more expensive.
