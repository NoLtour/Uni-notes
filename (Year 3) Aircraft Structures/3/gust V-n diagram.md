## Gust V-n diagram
 
We can plot the [[effect of gusts on load factor]] on top of the previous V-n diagram. Then something we find after considering gusts is the simple V-n diagram is insufficient

The marked points occur in level flight under reasonable gusts, they result in load factors outside of the range defined in [[V-n diagram|previous V-n diagram theory]]. 

Extending the V-n diagram makes it clear that this new boundary means that under turbulence load factor can fall outside the maximum permitted load factor ($n_{1}$), hence in these cases the pilot must reduce speed such that they don't.

Note that these velocities: $20m/s,\:\:15.25m/s\:and\:7.5m/s$ are typical gust values used in standards.
