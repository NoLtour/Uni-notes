## Aircraft design speeds

These are speeds defined by limit's on possible manoeuvres as a combination of structural, aerodynamic and efficiency limitations. They can be more easily described when considering them inside of a [[V-n diagram]].

>> where:
>> $V_{A}=$ The design manoeuvring speed, this is defined by the pitch up stalling limit intercepting with the maximum structural [[load factor]]
>> $V_{F}=$ The design manoeuvring speed, this is defined by the pitch down stalling limit intercepting with the maximum structural [[load factor]]
>> $V_{C}=$ The design cruise speed, this is selected by the speed which offers the best range, it must not be more than 80% of the design dive speed
>> $V_{D}=$ The design dive speed, this is a speed at least 25% higher than the design cruise speed at which the aircraft must be vibration and buffet free

Note that the difference in stall curve for positive and negative manoeuvres was previously explained, in the pitching down case stall is delayed due to favourable air flow which complements the flow turning performed by the airfoil when producing lift. This means that the airstream can remain attached at lower speeds delaying stall in downward pitching manoeuvres. The opposite effect is seen in upward pitching manoeuvres, hence the difference observed in the V-n diagram.
