## Equivalent airspeed and load factor relation


Taking the definition of [[load factor]] and [[equivalent airspeed]] it becomes clear that we can simplify [[load factor]] equations by using [[equivalent airspeed]] to simplify out density:

$$\begin{align*}
&&& &&& V_{eq}^{2}&= V^{2}\rho\\
n &= \frac{L}{W} &&\to& n &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^{2} S C_{L}}{mg} &&\to& n &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} V_{eq}^{2} S C_{L}}{mg}
\end{align*}$$

Which becomes useful when working with [[pitot-static tube|pitot tube]] as they allow you to easily determine equivalent airspeed.
