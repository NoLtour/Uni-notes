## V-n diagram

Pretty much all a V-n diagram is, is a chart representing the range of n values ([[load factor]]) and V values ([[true airspeed]]) that the aircraft should operate within. Some obvious factors which act to discriminate against certain values are:
- V being too low and the aircraft stalling
- High [[load factor]] imparting unsafe g forces on [[or as I call them expendable meat sacks|passengers]] or structures

This range of permittable attitudes can also be though of as the aircrafts [[V-n diagram|flight envelope]]. In this module we're considering [[symmetric manoeuvre]] loads, this is because forces in other directions are generally significantly smaller than the vertical axis. So don't pose significant risk to aircraft structure.

Recalling [[maximum load factor]]:

$$\begin{align*}
n &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} \rho S C_{L} V^{2}}{W} &&\to& n &= \frac{\frac{1}{2} S \frac{dC_{L}}{d\alpha} }{mg} \:\rho V^{2} \alpha 
\end{align*}$$

Looking at how load factor changes for different densities, we'll need [[V-n diagram]]s for different altitudes. The mass value's also of interest, since the [[V-n diagram]] will change depending on cargo and fuel.
