## Stressed skin

Stressed skin is a rigid construction in which the skin or covering takes a portion of the structural load, intermediate between [[monocoque]], in which the skin assumes all or most of the load, and a [[rigid frame]], which has a non-loaded covering. Typically, the main frame has a rectangular structure and is triangulated by the covering; a stressed skin structure has localized compression-taking elements (rectangular frame) and distributed tension-taking elements (skin).

The modern approach in aircraft is to use [[stressed skin]] construction, as it allows a weight efficient structure that is well suited for both compression and tension.
