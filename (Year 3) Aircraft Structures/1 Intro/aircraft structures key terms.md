>> where:
>> $F_{L}=$ Limit load, the maximum load the structure will experience over it's anticipated service life. This provides an indication of the maximum loads that the structure is designed for.
>> $F_{F}=$ Failure load, [[made up by me|the maximum sustainable load before failure]]
>> $F_{P}=$ Proof load, the structure must be able to withstand the proof load without permanent deformation
>> $\mu_{P}=$ proof factor, the factor relating proof load to limit load. Typically this is either 1 or 1.25
>> $F_{U}=$ ultimate load, failure doesn't occur at the design ultimate load. The ultimate factor of safety is typically 1.5. Ensure that $F_{U}<F_{U}$ such that we have absolute certainty $F_{U}$ is safe.
>> $\mu_{U}=$ ultimate factor,  the factor relating ultimate load to limit load
>> $R_{f}=$ reserve factor
>> $M_{S}=$ Margin of safety, this is similar to but different from [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]]

Structures are tested to the ultimate load and MUST NOT fail. Structures are tested under the proof load and must sustain normal operation (such as attitude control) with no permanent deformation.
