#### What is
## Diode rectification
Basically this is (a big reason) why we learned the [[n-p diode]] stuff, we can slap this shmuk into a circuit and force current in one direction. This can be used to convert [[alternating current]] into [[direct current]], here are the methods we care about:
- [[half-wave rectification]]
- [[full-wave rectification]]
- [[smoothing and ripple reduction (circuit)]]
