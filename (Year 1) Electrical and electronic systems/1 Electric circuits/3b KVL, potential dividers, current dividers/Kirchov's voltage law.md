#### What is
## Kirchov's voltage law
This states that the sum of [[potential difference]]s around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.

If you remember that potential difference is essentially just the difference in electron pressure between two points, then this law makes sense since if you make a full loop then the sum of electron pressure changes will be zero.

$V_S + V_L = 0$

This can also be applied across parrallel circuits.

Here you can see this circuit has 2 closed loops, and going back to [[nodes in circuit analysis]], we know that this ciruit has 2 wire sections, and so the difference between the electron pressure between these will be the same, hence the uniform p.d across both resistors.
