#### What is
## Guass's law (electric field)
This is a law relating the distrobution of electric charge to the resaulting electric field.
In it's integral form, it states that the flux of the electric field out of an arbitrary [[closed surface]] is proprotional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface, independent of how that charge is distrobuted.

Remove all the fluff and: "the electric field out of a [[closed surface]] is proprotional to the electric charge enclosed by the surface"

> $$ \phi_E =  \frac{\sum\limits q}{\epsilon_0}$$ 
>> where:
>> $\phi_E=$ [[electric flux]] 
>> $\sum\limits q=$ The sum of electric charges within the surface
>> $\epsilon_0=$ [[permitivity of free space (electric)]]
