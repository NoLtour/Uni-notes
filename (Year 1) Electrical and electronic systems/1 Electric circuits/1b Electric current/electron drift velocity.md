#### What is
## electron drift velocity
Electron drift velocity is the average velocity of the electrons in a area.

#### Calculating it
We know from [[Electric current|current]] that $A=Q/t$, if we assume a wire has a radius of 0.1cm and it's made of copper (charge carrier density is $\rho_e=8.5*10^{22}cm^{-3}$), then we can calculate the electron's velocity:

we know:
$$ \frac{electrons}{second} = 1 A = \frac{Q}{t}=\frac{1}{e}$$

and:
$$ \frac{electrons}{second}= \pi r^{2}\rho_e v $$

so equating the two gets us:
$$ \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{e}&=\pi r^{2}\rho_e v\\
\frac{1}{e\pi r^{2}\rho_e}&=v
\end{align*} $$

plugging in the values gives a velocity of $0.002cms^{-1}$, given this is a realistic example, you can see electrons drift incredibly slowly.
