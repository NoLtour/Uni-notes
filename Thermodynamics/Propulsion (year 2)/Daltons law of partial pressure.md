## Daltons law of partial pressure

### The law

Basically this states "the net pressure in a mixture is equal to the sum of the pressure that each component in the mixture would exert individually under the same conditions in the same volume", or put into an equation:

> ### $$\begin{align*} P  &= \sum\limits^{k}_{i=1} P_{i}(V,T)  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $P=$ pressure of the mixture
>> $P_{i}=$ the pressure of some component (by [[the 2 property rule|two property rule]] can be expressed as a function of volume and temperature)

### Partial pressure

> ### $$\begin{align*}\frac{P_{i}}{P}  &=  y_{i} = \frac{n_{i}}{n}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $P=$ pressure of the mixture
>> $P_{i}=$ the pressure of some component  
>> $y_{i}=$ [[definitions of mixtures|molar fraction]]
>> $n_{i}=$ [[mole|moles]] of the component present in the mixture
>> $n=$ total [[mole|moles]] of mixture

This can be proven quite easily using [[ideal gas law]], though I THINK the equation does still hold for non ideal gas (mostly gut feeling).
