# Compressible flow overview

#### Intro and contents
The time has finally come, we are going to (not) assume an incompressible flow... (the [[I am shaking rn|horror]]).

In this section we will start with identifying the difference between compressible and incompressible flow. We will see that compressibility adds complexity due to the coupling of density to temperature and pressure in the ideal gas law. We will then simplify the compressible equations by looking at steady one-dimensional, inviscid flow without thermal diffusion.
