## Entropy 2 electric boogaloo

### Entropy

#### The first TdS equation

This equation is built without the use of any assumptions and is universally applicable.

> ### $$\begin{align*}  T dS &= dU + p \:dV  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $T=$ temperature
>> $S=$ [[entropy]]
>> $U=$ [[internal energy]]
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $V=$ volume



#### The second TdS equation

This equation is built without the use of any assumptions and is universally applicable.

> ### $$\begin{align*}  T dS &= dH - V \:dp  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $T=$ temperature
>> $S=$ [[entropy]]
>> $H=$ [[enthalpy]] 
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $V=$ volume
