## [[steady flow energy equation|SFEE]] simplifications for propulsion application

We will now look at simplifications of the SFEE that we usually make when analysing a gas turbine. They will also apply for ramjets, but just without the compressor and the turbine. What we will show here are basically the ‘simplest’ forms and the most ideal processes. This should get you started in being able to analyse various propulsion systems. Later in the module, and also a little later in this chapter, you will make adjustments so your calculations can resemble reality more closely.
