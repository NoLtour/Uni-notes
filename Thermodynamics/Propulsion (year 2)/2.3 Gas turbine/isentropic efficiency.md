## Isentropic efficiency

You know how we've been modelling lots of processes as ideal [[isentropic process|isentropic]] processes to clean up the maths? Well instead of doing a proper job and developing theory further to account for real world shite why not just take the tried and tested [[nerds try and figure out the truth of the universe we just need things to work lol|engineering approach]]... slapping in a constant to correct for error? Introducing: "Isentropic efficiency factor".

K so lets look at some [[TS diagram]]s to get an idea of what I mean, so the dotted line is realisting the black one is ideal:
