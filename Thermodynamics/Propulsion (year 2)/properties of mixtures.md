## Properties of mixtures
In an ideal gas, all molecules behave independently, as if no other molecules are present in the system. This results in [[Daltons law of partial pressure]],  but we can also use it to calculate the [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)|extensive properties]] of mixtures. Noting that extensive properties depend on the amount of material, we can write the following for the [[internal energy]]:

$$\begin{align*}
U &= \sum\limits U_{i}\\
&= \sum\limits m_{i} u_{i}
\end{align*}$$

Though this was shown for [[internal energy]] it'll also work with any other [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)|extensive property]], lets take it one step further though; if we want to convert extensive properties to intensive properties, we simply divide by the total mass, which turns the masses into mass fractions

$$\begin{align*}
U &= \sum\limits m_{i} u_{i} & &\to & u &= \sum\limits \frac{m_{i}}{m} u_{i} & &\to & u&= \sum\limits x_{i} u_{i}
\end{align*}$$

K popping that into a nicer format:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \mathcal{P} &= \sum\limits \mathcal{P}_{i}  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \mathcal{P} &= \sum\limits \mathcal{p}_{i} m_{i} \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \mathcal{p} &= \sum\limits \mathcal{p}_{i} x_{i} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\mathcal{P}=$ some [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)|extensive property]]
>> $\mathcal{p}=$ some [[intensive properties (thermodynamics)|intensive property]]
>> $m_{i}=$ mass of component
>> $x_{i}=$ [[definitions of mixtures|mass fraction]] of compoennt
