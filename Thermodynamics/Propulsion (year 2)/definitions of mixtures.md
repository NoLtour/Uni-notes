## Definitions of mixtures
### Obvious shite
Because we will be analysing combustion processes, a basic understanding of mixtures of gases is required. We start with a rather [[I like to read this in a condesending rude voice|obvious]] relation, the total mass $m$ of a mixture given the masses of the components $m_a$ and $m_b$ (I just copy and pasted but I like that wording lol):

$$\begin{align*}
m &= m_{a} + m_{b}\\
m&= \sum\limits^{k}_{i=1} m_{i}
\end{align*}$$

In the same way the total number of moles is the sum of [[mole|moles]] ([[flavour text|fucking mind blowing]] stuff):

$$\begin{align*}
n &= \sum\limits^{k}_{i=1} n_{i}
\end{align*}$$

Something to keep in mind is that although through processes mass might be conserved number of moles can change due to chemical reactions.

### Mass fraction ($x$)

This is the fraction of a mixture that is some other thing (by mass):

> ### $$\begin{align*} x_{i}  &= \frac{m_{i}}{m}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $x_{i}=$ mass fraction consisting of a component
>> $m_{i}=$ mass of the component present in the mixture
>> $m=$ total mass of mixture


### Molar fraction ($y$)

This is the fraction of a mixture that is some other thing (by [[mole|moles]]):

> ### $$\begin{align*} y_{i}  &= \frac{n_{i}}{n}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $y_{i}=$ molar fraction consisting of a component
>> $n_{i}=$ [[mole|moles]] of the component present in the mixture
>> $n=$ total [[mole|moles]] of mixture

### Relation between mass and molar fraction

> ### $$\begin{align*} x_{i}  &= y_{i} \frac{M_{i}}{M}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $x_{i}=$ mass fraction consisting of a component
>> $y_{i}=$ molar fraction consisting of a component
>> $M_{i}=$ [[specific molecular weight|molar mass]] of the component
>> $M= \frac{m}{n}=$ [[specific molecular weight|molar mass]] of the whole mixture
