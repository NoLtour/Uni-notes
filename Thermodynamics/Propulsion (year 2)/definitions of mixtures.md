## Definitions of mixtures

Because we will be analysing combustion processes, a basic understanding of mixtures of gases is required. We start with a rather [[I like to read this in a condesending rude voice|obvious]] relation, the total mass $m$ of a mixture given the masses of the components $m_a$ and $m_b$ (I just copy and pasted but I like that wording lol):

$$\begin{align*}
m &= m_{a} + m_{b}\\
m&= \sum\limits^{k}_{i=1} m_{i}
\end{align*}$$

In the same way the total number of moles is the sum of [[mole|moles]] ([[flavour text|fucking mind blowing]] stuff):

$$\begin{align*}
n &= \sum\limits^{k}_{i=1} n_{i}
\end{align*}$$
