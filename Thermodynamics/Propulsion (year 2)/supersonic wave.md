## Supersonic wave

We will consider an inviscid fluid in a pipe at rest, with a small disturbance initiated from the left, as shown in the image. 
The disturbance is a small increase in velocity δU , which will send a wave through the pipe, travelling at the speed of sound a. 
To the right of the wave front, the fluid is still at rest and doesn’t ‘know’ about the disturbance yet. To the left of the wave front, the fluid has obtained a velocity δU , as well as changes in the other properties of the fluid (e.g., pressure, density, temperature, enthalpy). 
We will assume that these changes happen reversibly and adiabatically, and therefore assume no change in entropy.

To simplify our analysis we will use a reference frame travelling with the wave front at speed a.
Figure 3.3 shows the wave front with a small control volume drawn around it. Fluid enters the control
volume from the right at speed a, and leaves the control volume on the left at a speed a − δU . The
