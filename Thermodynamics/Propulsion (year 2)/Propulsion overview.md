# Propulsion overview

Something to note is I will be doing a lot more direct copy and pasting of notes for this, since the thermo notes are both well done and looooong (cba to rewrite if not needed). I will still add links where appropriate and label important equations so this should be basically normal notes + extra features. Thanks whoever wrote the thermo notes for [[it is not notes theft since I gave credit|doing a good]] job.

Thermodynamics is back boi, this time with a focus on making things go [[brrrrr|shitting out thrust]]. Read order:
1) [[Introduction to propulsion overview]]
2) [[Thermodynamics definitions overview]], [[Thermodynamics mixtures overview]] and [[Introduction to gas turbines overview]]
