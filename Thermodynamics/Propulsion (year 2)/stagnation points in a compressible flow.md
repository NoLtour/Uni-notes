## Stagnation points in a compressible flow

![[Pasted image 20230222204512.png]]

We are often interested in the properties of a fluid when it has lost all kinetic energy. We will consider a flow from point 1 to point 0 as indicated in figure 3.1. At point 0, the flow stagnates and we can use the conservation of energy equation directly to define the stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ and a bunch of other "stagnation things":

> ### $$\begin{align*} h_{0}  &= h + \frac{1}{2} U^{2}  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} T_{0} &= T + \frac{U}{2c_{p}} \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} P_{0} &= P \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}} \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \rho_{0} &= \rho \left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $h_{0}=$ stagnation specific [[enthalpy]]
>> $T_{0}=$ stagnation temp
>> $P_{0}=$ stagnation pressure
>> $\rho_{0}=$ stagnation density
>> $h=$ specific [[enthalpy]] at some point
>> $T=$ temp at some point
>> $P=$ pressure at some point
>> $\rho=$ density at some point
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $c_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]]

>Note that since these are derived from the [[streamline analysis in a compressible flow]] they share the same assumptions, additionally these assume a [[perfect gas]].

There isn't need to know the proofs (and they are long) so [[I am justified in this though|yeah]].
