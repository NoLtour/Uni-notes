## Stagnation points in a compressible flow

![[Pasted image 20230222204512.png]]

We are often interested in the properties of a fluid when it has lost all kinetic energy. We will consider a flow from point 1 to point 0 as indicated in figure 3.1. At point 0, the flow stagnates and we can use the conservation of energy equation directly to define the stagnation enthalpy $h_0$ and a bunch of other things
