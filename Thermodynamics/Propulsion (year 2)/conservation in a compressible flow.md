## Conservation in a compressible flow

We start by looking at the full set of equations required to describe three-dimensional unsteady flow. We donâ€™t have to worry about directly using these equations, but we will use them to arrive at simplified versions that we can more easily use. K so these are the no assumption defenitions for:
$$\begin{align*}
 & \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j} } (\rho U_{j}) &= 0
\end{align*}$$
