#### What is a
## Lagrangian specification of the flow field
This is an approach for where you place your perspective in a situation involving fluid motion.
In the [[Lagrangian specification of the flow field]] the perspective of the observer is taken from the fluid thats moving, hence the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] being considered looks like it's moving while the fluid remains still.

This is the opposite of the [[Eulerian specification of the flow field]].
