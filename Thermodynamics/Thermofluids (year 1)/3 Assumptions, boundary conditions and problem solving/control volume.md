#### What is a
## Control volume
### Defenition
A control volume is a fixed region in space chosen for the thermodynamic study of mass and energy balances for flowing systems. The boundary of the control volume may be a real or imaginary envelope. The control surface is the boundary of the control volume.

At steady state, a control volume can be thought of as an arbitrary volume in which the mass of the continuum remains constant. As a continuum moves through the control volume, the mass entering the control volume is equal to the mass leaving the control volume.

Unlike a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] which has no mass transfer across it's [[system boundary]].

### Momentum conservation

To find the net force acting on a control volume it's just conservation of momentum + normal pressure on the control volume boundary.
