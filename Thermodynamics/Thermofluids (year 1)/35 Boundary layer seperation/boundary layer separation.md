#### Describe
## [[boundary layer|Boundary layer]] separation

Flow separation occurs when the boundary layer travels far enough against an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer relative to the object falls almost to zero. The fluid flow becomes detached from the surface of the object, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices. The pressure gradient can also lead to some level of backflow.

This of course leads to tones of problems since it stalls airfoils and generally creates tones of drag. Which is known in the industry as "a [[as opposed to a piss storm which is not as bad|shitstorm]]"
