#### What is
## Viscosity ($\mu$)
Units are generally Newton seconds per meter squared: $Nsm^{-2}$.

This is a characteristic of all fluids ([[idk not enough shitposting but superfluids are real look it up|except superfluids]] but those only exist in labs) and causes [[viscous flow]], the viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate. For liquids, it corresponds to the informal concept of "thickness": for example, syrup has a higher viscosity than water.
