#### What is the
## Fluid no slip condition
Basically:

There is not net movement relative to a surface in a thin layer of fluid in contact with the surface, this is because the force from the fluid-surface interface is much greater than the intermolecular forces in the fluid. The thickness of this layer varies depending on lots of conditions but it's a very real thing not just some ideal model, as can be seen in the data above.

In some conditions such as hypersonic flows, micro-fluidics and very low pressure environments (such as nearing space) this condition may not hold.
