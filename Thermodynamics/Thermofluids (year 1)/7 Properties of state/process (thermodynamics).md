#### What is a
## Process (thermodynamics)
The change of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] from one [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] state to another is called a thermodynamic process.

For example the process might be gas expansion.

To fully specify a process, not only the start and end state should be known, but also the [[path (thermodynamics)|path]]. The path determines the amount of work (W ) and heat transfer (Q) that is done during the process. Two different paths between state A and B can have very different work output, as shown here (in a [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]]):
