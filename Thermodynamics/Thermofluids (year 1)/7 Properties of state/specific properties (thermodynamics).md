#### What are
## Specific properties (thermodynamics)
These are [[properties (thermodynamics)|properties]] that are defined per unit mass. They are a type of [[intensive properties (thermodynamics)|intensive property]].

For example "specific volume" (units are $m^{3}/kg$):

$v = \frac{V}{m}$

Here $v$ is specific volume and $V$ is total volume ($m$ is mass duhhh). This convention will be seen quite often, generally in thermodynamics [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific properties]] are notated with lower case letters while [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)|extensive properties]] are notated with upper case letters.
