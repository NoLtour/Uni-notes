#### What is
## Equilibrium (thermodynamics)
This is when there is no net change in the properties of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] over time.

This implies:
 - Thermal equilibrium, a uniform temperature, and therefore no tendency for [[heat]] transfer.
 - Mechanical equilibrium, all forces are balanced, and therefore no tendency to accelerate.
 - Phase equilibrium, no tendency for phase changes.
 - Chemical equilibrium, no tendency for chemical change.

Note that these should all be viewed on a macroscopic scale, and not on a microscopic (molecular) scale. For example, individual molecules will continuously change their kinetic energy due to collisions with other molecules, but on a macroscopic scale they average out and we can measure a single temperature.
