#### What are
## Properties (thermodynamics)
These things that describe a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]]. (look this is such a basic description I struggle to come up with one)

For example some of the most basic properties of a system include: pressure, temperature, volume, internal energy, [[enthalpy]].

Properties that define the state of a system are called state properties. There is an almost endless list of state properties, but the ones that we will encounter the most are listed in the table below with their SI units. We distinguish between different types of properties: intensive, extensive, and specific properties.
- [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)]]
- [[intensive properties (thermodynamics)]]
- [[specific properties (thermodynamics)]]
