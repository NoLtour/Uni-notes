#### What is
## Closed form
In mathematics, a closed-form expression is a mathematical expression that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain well-known operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration (though this depends on author and context).

My definition: "a mathamatical expression that [[unlike me (more like geneva suggestion)|obeys the geneva convention]]"
