#### What are the properties of a
## Diesel engine
### Main differences
The way that a diesel engine functions is very simular to a [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]], but there are some key differences:
- A diesel engine is a [[compression ignition engine]] while an [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]] is a [[spark ignition engine]].
- Fuel in a diesel engine is injected much closer to the [[reciprocating engines|TDC]] while in a [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]] it is injected during the intake stroke
- Diesel is a much less volitile fuel (hence why spark ignition isn't used), so it is safer to store. It is also more energy dense.
- Uses [[diesel cycle]]

### Combustion

Since in diesel engines the fuel is ignited via compression, the exact moment ignition occurs at varys each stroke which leads to slight inefficiency compared to perfectly controlled ignition and more vibration, we tend to compensate for this by increasing the mass of the engine.

Properties of the combustion process:
- Heat addition is a constant pressure process therefore knock is impossible during the compression stroke. (This kinda confuses me tbh, revisit this later)
- Since knock dosn't occur you can get greater [[volume compression ratio (engines)|compression ratios]] and hence greater efficiencys.
- Due to reduced premature ignition a wider range of fuels can be used.
