#### What is
## Relative roughness ($k_{s}$)
### Intro
In real world situations all surfaces have some level of roughness, this of course interacts with flow in pipes and causes turbulance on the surface. On the other hand larger pipe diameters are less influenced by the condition of the surface of the pipe since there are more layers of fluid insulating the inner more laminar flow from the outer turbulant flow, so a non dimentionalised value known as [[relative roughness]] becomes useful.

### Equation
Relative roughness is just the absolute roughness of a pipe divided by it's diameter:

> ### $$ k_{s} = \frac{\varepsilon}{D} $$ 
>> where:
>> $k_{s}=$ [[relative roughness]]
>> $\varepsilon=$ [[absolute roughness (pipe)]]
>> $D=$ pipe diameter
