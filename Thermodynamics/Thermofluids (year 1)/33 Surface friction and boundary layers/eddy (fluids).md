#### What is a
## Eddy (fluids)
In fluid dynamics, an eddy is the swirling of a fluid and the reverse current created when the fluid is in a [[turbulent flow regime]]:

The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing fluid on the downstream side of the object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a swirl of fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, toward the back of the obstacle. This phenomenon is naturally observed behind large emergent rocks in swift-flowing rivers. 

At the top you can see what is known as [[vortex shedding]], eddies can also exist in other forms (even in electronics, [[eddy currents (electonics)|eddy current]]):
