#### What is the
## Ideal gas law
It's proved in [[pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas|this page]].

### Assumptions
1) The particles are rigid, with no momentum or time being lost during collisions
2) The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume
3) The force between adjacent particles is negligible

These hold true for most common situations, but high: temp's, pressures or densitys can [[this is the technical term|fuck it up]]. When this occurs you can usually use the [[Van der Waals equation]].

Also in an ideal gas temperature is a function of internal energy of the gas, so if there is no change in total internal energy (no work is done) then temperature dosn't change.

#### Limitations of applicability
Although for real gases these assumptions are never fully satisfied, the ideal gas model is often still very accurate. For example, using the ideal gas equation to calculate the density of air at room temperature:

The main limitations to be aware of are when (i) approaching phase transitions, and (ii) at high pressures. At high pressures, the volume occupied by the molecules becomes non-negligible, and near phase transitions intermolecular forces become significant. 
In quantitative terms, the pressure should be much smaller than the critical pressure for the ideal gas equation to be accurate. The [[critical pressure]] of a gas can again be looked up in tables. Air, for example, has a critical pressure of approximately 38 bar. Figure 2.2 shows the real density of air compared to that calculated using the ideal gas law as a function of pressure. When the pressure approaches 20 bar, the error in density is still only 1%.
