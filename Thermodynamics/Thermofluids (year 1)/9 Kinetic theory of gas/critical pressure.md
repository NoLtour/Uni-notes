## Critical pressure 
The critical pressure of a substance is the pressure corresponding to the critical point (or the critical state) of the substance. The critical point of a substance can be defined as the point on the temperature and pressure scale in which a liquid substance can coexist with its vapour. At temperatures above the critical temperature of a substance, it cannot be liquified with the application of any amount of pressure. The critical pressure of a substance can, therefore, be defined as the pressure that must be applied to a substance in order to liquify it at its critical temperature. The critical pressure of a substance is often denoted by the symbol ‘PC’.
