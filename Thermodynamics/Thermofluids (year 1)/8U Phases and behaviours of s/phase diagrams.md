#### What are
## Phase diagrams
A phase diagram is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at equilibrium. For example phase diagrams for water are:

On the second one the flat sections represent temperatures where forms with different densitys exist, these occur at temperatures where phase changes occur. Water has some unique properties that cause it to become more dense when melting hence there is also a line to represent how normal substances behave.

Also note that phase diagrams can also be 3D:
