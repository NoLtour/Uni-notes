#### What is
## Constant pressure specific heat ($C_p$)
This is [[specific heat capacity]] for a subastance at a constant pressure.

> ### $$ C_{p} = C_{v} + R $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]] 
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
