#### What is
## Specific heat capacity ($c$)
### Main def
Note that for all of these I'm using [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific]] hence the lower case $c$'s, there is also just heat capacity which is the [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)|extensive version]].

This is the change in internal energy required to increase the temperature of 1kg of a given substance by 1K. 
Specific heat capacity usually changes with temperature, if a gas has a constant specific heat for all temperatures we call it a [[perfect gas]].

### Types

There are multiple types of specific heat capacity:
- [[constant volume specific heat]] ($c_v$)
- [[constant pressure specific heat]] ($c_p$)

For an [[ideal gas law|ideal gas]], both the internal energy and the enthalpy are a function of temperature only, and therefore the specific heats are also a function of temperature only (look at the defenitions of $c_{V}$ and $c_{P}$). 

### Approximations

Although most gases are not [[perfect gas]]es, they can often be approximated as such especially over small temp ranges.
