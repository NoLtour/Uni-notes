#### What is
## Constant volume specific heat ($C_v$)
This is [[specific heat capacity]] for a substance at a constant volume. 
> ### $$ C_{v} = C_{p} - R $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]] 
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
