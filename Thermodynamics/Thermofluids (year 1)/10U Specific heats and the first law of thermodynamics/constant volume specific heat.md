#### What is
## Constant volume specific heat ($c_v$)
This is [[specific heat capacity]] for a substance at a constant volume. 
> ### $$ c_{v} = c_{p} - R $$ 
>> where:
>> $c_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]] 
>> $c_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]

By using this and a bunch of definitions you get that:

> ### $$\begin{align*} c_{V}  &= \left. \frac{du}{dT} \right|_{V=const}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $c_{V}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $u=$ [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific]] [[internal energy]]
>> $T=$ temperature
