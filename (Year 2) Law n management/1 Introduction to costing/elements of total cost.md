## Elements of total cost
![[Pasted image 20221108111737.png]]

### Direct costs
Direct costs are those costs that can be directly related to a specific product or service, such as: materials used, labour used or other expenses.

### Indirect costs
Indirect costs are those costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific product or service. They can be classified into:
- Production overhead (eg: building maintenance, canteen, building insurance)
- Selling/distribution overhead
- Administration overhead

Indirect costs can almost be described as costs which are not worth keeping track of the specifics about.

### Fixed costs
Costs which are pretty much unaffected by fluctuations in output and tend to be related to a fixed set of time instead of a fixed output.

We describe them as fixed relative to the time scale we are observing, since in reality all costs vary given enough time.

### Variable costs
Vary in the short term, often with the level of activity in the organisation.

### Limitations of costing definition
Pretty much all costs have variable and fixed aspects which often means the category a cost is placed into is somewhat arbitrary.
