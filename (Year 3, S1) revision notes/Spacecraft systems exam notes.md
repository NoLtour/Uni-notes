### Problem sheet 1: Mission Selection, Payload Selection and Remote Sensing

4 - Identify four microwave remote sensing techniques that can be used by instruments on an Earth-
orbiting satellite and explain the possible impacts of each instrument on the power and attitude
control sub-systems

6 - A satellite in a dawn dusk Sun-synchronous 720 km circular orbit is to be used to measure the extent
and characteristics of ice extent over the poles. Propose a suitable payload for this orbit and
application and give reasons for your choice.

7 - A satellite in a circular orbit at an altitude of 616 km uses a single waveband (panchromatic)
instrument with a focal length f = 4 m to provide imagery of the Earth’ surface. Images are built-up
line-by-line using a push-broom scanning method, the instrument has a linear CCD sensor with N =
8000 pixels and an inter-detector spacing w = 13 m. Each pixel is encoded using Q = 8 bits. Use the
information above and formulae below:
a. How many discrete Digital Numbers can be used to represent the reflectance of each pixel?
b. What is the spatial resolution of the instrument in the cross track direction (defined by the
Ground-projected Sample Interval)?
c. What speed does the sub-satellite point travel over the Earth’s surface?
d. What is the approximate swath width of the instrument?
e. If the spatial resolution of the instrument in the in-track direction is the same as the spatial
resolution in the cross-track direction, at what rate does the CCD array need to be sampled?
f. What is the uncompressed data rate of the instrument in bits per second?

### Problem sheet 2: Space Debris Guidelines and Standards

Rocket equation

Orbital energy

ISP

 2 - Explain what international space debris mitigation guidelines exist and their impact on spacecraft
systems design.

GEO, guidelines (UN guides) A minimum increase in perigee altitude of 235 km + (1000×CR×A/m), where CR is the solar
radiation pressure coefficient and A/m is the cross-sectional area to dry mass ratio (m2kg-1), and
- An eccentricity less than or equal to 0.003

#### Q2
2. A polar research station in the Antarctic requires 24-hour coverage in order to provide transmission
of telemetry and science data. By discussing the advantages and disadvantages, compare and
contrast two orbit options for this system.
[8 marks]
LEO constellation v Molniya-type constellation with perigee in Northern hemisphere (GEO not an option for
Antarctic coverage)
(4 sets from below, or other valid)
 Low power v high power
 Minimal change in received signal power v variation in signal power
 Simple ground station v ground station must track satellites
 Eclipse v no eclipse during comms operations
 Many satellites for coverage v three satellites for 24-hour coverage
 Smaller satellites (< 1000 kg) v larger satellites (> 1000 kg)
 Limited radiation v passage through Van Allen belts each orbit

#### Q3
A Walker-Star constellation contains 36 small satellites in six orbital planes inclined at 85. Calculate
the in-plane spacing between the satellites and the node spacing.

### Q5
5. A low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation is used to achieve complete (24 hour) coverage of the Equator,
such that the coverage of each satellite is required to span from the node of the next most westerly
orbit plane to the node of the next most easterly plane (with a similar requirement for satellite
separation in-plane) as in Figure 2. If the minimum acceptable elevation at the edge of coverage is
10°, and the orbital height of the constellation, H, is 5400 km, use the data provided to determine
the minimum number of satellites in the constellation.
