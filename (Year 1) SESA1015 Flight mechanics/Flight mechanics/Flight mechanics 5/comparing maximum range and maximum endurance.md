#### What are the results of
## Comparing maximum range and maximum endurance
#### [[endurance equation|Endurance equation]] (max time for fuel)
![[endurance equation#^76741c]]

#### [[Breguet range equation (jets)]] (max distance for fuel)
![[Breguet range equation (jets)#^20c05c]]

### Comparison

Although very similar there is a key difference in how speed effects the equation:
- Maximum endurance requires a maximum and constant $L/D$
- Maximum range requires a maximum and constant $VL/D$

This means choosing between maximizing range or maximizing endurance effects what [[cruise pattern]] you will choose.
