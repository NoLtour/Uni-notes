#### What is
## Static margin ($K_n$)
### Key info
This is the rearmost allowable C of G position for [[longitudional static stability and trim|longitudional static stability]]. Any C of G positions aft of this point will result in a statically unstable aircraft stick fixed.

> ### $$ K_n = h_n - h $$ 
>> where:
>> $K_n=$ [[static margin]] 
>> $h=$ [[aircraft controls and dimentions for calculating longitudional stability#^267a4d|fraction of the wing chord from the leading edge to centre of gravity]]
>> $h_n=h_0 + \bar{V}\frac{a_{1T}}{a_1} \left(1 - \frac{d\varepsilon}{d\alpha}\right)$ from [[longitudional static stability and trim#^29c51c]]
>> $K_n>0$ for static stability

### Proof

It can be derived easily from [[longitudional static stability and trim#Equations n implications]]:
