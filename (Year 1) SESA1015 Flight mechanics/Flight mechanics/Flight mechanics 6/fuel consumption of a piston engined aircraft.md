#### What is the
## Fuel consumption of a piston engined aircraft
### Introduction
Unlike jets that use [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)]], piston engines have their sfc measured in different units:
- sfc (aircraft), $Newtons(Fuel)/Second\cdot Netwon(Thrust)$
- sfc (engine), $Newtons(Fuel)/Second \cdot Power$

So now to get fuel per second to thrust per second we need to covert power to thrust, this is done through a propeller.

>> $\frac{dW(t)}{dt}=$ Weight of fuel change per second 
>> $P=$ Power
>> $s'=$ [[fuel consumption of a piston engined aircraft|specific fuel consumption (engine)]]
