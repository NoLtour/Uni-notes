#### What are the
## Inaccuracys when modeling cruise patterns
### Intro
Generally we assume that drag is entirely defined in the [[Drag equation]] and that [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]] is constant when modelling [[cruise pattern|cruise climb technique]]s.


### Inaccuracys
#### [[compresibility drag|Compresibility drag]]
Though that said the true value is different as this analysis has not taken into account compressibility drag, which means in reality optimum cruise heights and are greater in real situations. When accounting for the [[compresibility drag]] rise that occurs at high [[Mach number]]s it becomes desirable to increase altitude maintaining an almost constant mach number till drag is minamised; this decrease in $\rho$ means that a higher $C_L$ is also needed in reality.

You can see the effect of the mach number on the lift coefficient and L/D ratio:

#### [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]]
Another factor that leads to inaccuracy is the assumption of a constant [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]], although in reality the [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]] of turbojets is quite constant the s.f.c of turbofans increases slightly with [[Mach number]] leading to the speed of the plane being further from mach number.
