#### What's the cause of the
## profile drag coefficient ($C_{Do}$)
This is caused by the boundary layer which forms on the aircraft, this forms due to the air's viscosity. The drag can be split into two parts:
- The friction drag caused by the airs viscosity ([[skin drag]])
- The drag due to the normal pressures [[form drag]]

This is what is responsible for "parasitic drag", the annoying sources of drag which do not produce lift.
