## Pitching moment coefficient ($C_{M0}$)

It is usually taken about the [[aerodynamic centre]]. Since taking it about here makes it invariant with changing [[angle of attack]].

This actually changes depending on where you measure from so keeping this in mind is incredibly important. (see [[measuring pitching moments on a plane]])

When you are given the value of a pitching moment coefficient, you also need a reference for where it's rotating about else the value is useless.
