highest this can be is about 1.2

when flying at crusing speed this is about 0.2 to 0.5, this is because during takeoff and landing it needs enough lift for its incredibly slow speeds (at which point it will have a coefficient closer to 1.2). It should be noted further that $C_L$ can get as high as 3 with the correct flap configuration to aid in take off and landing.
