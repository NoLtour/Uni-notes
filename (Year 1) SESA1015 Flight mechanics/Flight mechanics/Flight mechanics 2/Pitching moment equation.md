#### What's the
## Pitching moment equation
> $$ M = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S l C_M $$ 
>> where:
>> $M =$ Pitching moment
>> $\rho =$ density of air
>> $V =$  Velocity
>> $C_D=$ [[pitching moment coefficient]]
>> $S=$ [[refrence wing area]]
>> $l=$ [[typical length|Reference length]] (usually $l=\bar{c}$, [[Mean chord]])
