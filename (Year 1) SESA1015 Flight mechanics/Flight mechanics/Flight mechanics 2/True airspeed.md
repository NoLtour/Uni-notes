#### What is
## True airspeed
This is the speed of an aircraft relative to the air in which it is flying, it is incredibly important to know as true airspeed has a substatantial effect on lift, drag ect (since most equations are effected by the square of this factor). So clearly having a clear idea of what this value is, is important.
One method for measuring true air speed is with a [[pitot-static tube]], and using the pressure differences to calculate aircraft motion.
