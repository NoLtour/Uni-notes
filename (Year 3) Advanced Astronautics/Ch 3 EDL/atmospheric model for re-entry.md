## Atmospheric model for re-entry

The following is a simple exponential atmosphere model:

> ### $$\begin{align*} d\rho &= - \alpha \rho \:dh & \rho &= \rho_{S} e^{-\alpha h} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\alpha^{-1}=$ a constant (scale height)
>> $\rho_S =$ surface atmospheric density
>> $\rho=$ atmospheric density
>> $h=$ [[non-thrusting entry terms|height above surface]]

This model is a ok approximation and actually quite easy to derive. Not going into details but some assumptions include:
- Perfect gas with constant mixture
- Constant temperature in gas column
- Constant gravity
