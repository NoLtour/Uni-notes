## Lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry

### Ballistic
Ballistic re-entry, on the other hand, is a straightforward descent without significant aerodynamic control. Objects undergoing ballistic re-entry follow a more direct, unguided path and experience greater heat and stress during re-entry compared to lifting re-entry. The distinction lies in the level of aerodynamic control employed during the descent phase.


### Lifting
Lifting re-entry involves a spacecraft using aerodynamic lift, similar to an airplane, to control its descent during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. This method allows for more precise landing control.

Advantages:
- Significantly longer duration, lower heating and deceleration
- Control over landing sight
- Larger potential landing area
- Allows non-propulsive plane changes using aerodynamic forms
- Allows for a larger range of landing trajectory's

Disadvantages:
- Requires consideration of control surfaces
- Generally more complex
- Weight considerations
