## Lifting entry cross range

A benefit of lifting re-entry is the ability to make turns within the atmosphere and reach landing sites not in the orbital plane. This out of plane distance is called [[lifting entry cross range|cross range]].

The following equation is a approximation derived from math's beyond my paygrade.
 
> ### $$\begin{align*} Y_{max} &= \frac{V_{C}}{5.2g} \left(\frac{L}{D}\right)^{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 0.106\: (L/D)^{2}}} \end{align*}$$
>> where: 
>> $V_{C}=gr$ 
>> $Y_{MAX}=$ maximum cross distance
>> $g=g_{0}=$ acceleration due to gravity (constant)
>> $r=$ [[non-thrusting entry terms|radius from planetary centre]]
>> $L/D=$ [[lift to drag ratio]]

For global access you need $Y_{MAX} = \frac{2\pi r}{4}$
