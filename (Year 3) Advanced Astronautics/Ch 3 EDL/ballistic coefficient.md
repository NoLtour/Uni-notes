## Ballistic coefficient ($B$)

The ballistic coefficient is a numerical value that represents how well a bullet or other projectile retains its velocity and carries through the air.

> ### $$\begin{align*} B  &= \frac{m}{C_{D}A}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $B=$ [[ballistic coefficient]]
>> $m=$ mass
>> $C_{D}=$ [[drag coefficient]]
>> $A=$ cross sectional area
