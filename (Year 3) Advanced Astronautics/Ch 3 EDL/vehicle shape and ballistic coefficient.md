## Vehicle shape and ballistic coefficient

Re-entry vehicleâ€™s size and shape determines the [[ballistic coefficient]] and the amount of lift it will generate.

It should be noted that ballistic coefficient and lift/drag properties are unique when dealing with re-entry, as we travel waaaaaaaaaaaay above the speed of sound.
