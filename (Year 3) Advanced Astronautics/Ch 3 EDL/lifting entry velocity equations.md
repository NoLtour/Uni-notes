## Lifting entry velocity equations

The biggest difference that is seen in all derived [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|lifting re-entry]] equations vs [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|ballistic re-entry]] is the inclusion of lift (duh).

> ### $$\begin{align*}  t_{land} &= \frac{V_{c}}{2g} \frac{L}{D} \:\ln\left[\frac{ V_{C}^{2} + V_{?}^{2} }{ V_{C}^{2} -  V_{?}^{2}  }\right] \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} S_{land} &= -\frac{L}{D} \frac{V_{C}^{2}}{2g} \ln\left(1 - \frac{V_{0}^{2}}{V_{C}^{2}}\right)  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \left[\frac{\dot{V}}{g}\right]_{max} &= - \frac{1}{L/D} \end{align*}$$### $$\begin{align*} \frac{V_{max\:\dot{Q}}}{V_{C}} &= \sqrt \frac{2}{3} \end{align*}$$
