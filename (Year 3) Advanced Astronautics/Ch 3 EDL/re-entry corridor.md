## Re-entry corridor

This is the region inbetween the:
- Overshoot boundary, where missing can fling you back out. Depending on velocity possibly out of orbit.
- Undershoot boundary, where you get turned [[not ideal generally|into ash]].

So this is "the won't die region", generally we aim for this.
