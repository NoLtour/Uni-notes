## Challenge of designing for re-entry

The conditions during re-entry are very extreme, you can forget any sort of incompressibility or perfect gas assumptions. The extreme complexity means your limited to:
- Very complex simulations
- Expensive experimentations
- Even more expensive flight tests

Practically we use simulations and experimentation since flight tests literally involve the cost of doing an entire mission.
