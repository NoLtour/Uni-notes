## Heat management

#### Intro

Obviously we need strategies to manage heat, here we discuss 3:
- Heat sinks, using fat things to absorb heat
- Radiative cooling, discussed extensively
- Ablation, using state changes to reject heat

#### Heat sinks

The basic principal being add as much material as possible (often metallic) to “soak up” the excess heat generated during re-entry.
- Doesn't get rid of heat, so long as the mass is attached it just holds it
- Requires insulation between sink and sensitive components
- Increasing mass could increase heating on re-entry (self defeating to some extent)
- Weight obviously increases launch cost
- Can be reusable

Heat sinks are useful for [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|ballistic re-entry]], but are only a method for temporally routing heat away from sensitive components.

#### Radiative cooling
It uses high melting point materials with a high emissivity to radiate energy away from the spacecraft. These materials continue to heat up until the emitted energy balances the energy taken in – putting them in thermal equilibrium.

- Can lead to relatively light cooling solutions
- Heat rejection has limited capacity and tiles melting would lead to mission failure, requires extreme materials
- Suited of [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|lifting re-entry]]
- Cooling tiles require insulation from the structure
- Heat is rejected not stored
- Can be reusable

#### Ablation
A method of absorbing heat using latent heat of fusion (phase change)

- Large amounts of heat can be absorbed by coating the outside of re-entry vehicles with materials that have very high latent heats of fusion
- The material ablating away means that heat is rejected not stored
- Very light weight
- Best suited for [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|ballistic re-entry]]
- Not reusable
