# 3 Entry, decent and landing Overview

#### Intro and contents
Ok so today we are looking at [[that is yes|the EDL]]. Damn thing's are getting spicy. [[eeeed|EDL]] can be quite challenging to deal with, it involves very violent problems but is [[really important you know|critical]] for many missions.

Of course I'm speaking about entry decent and landing. Some of the basic issues include:
- High deceleration rate
- High dynamic pressure
- Severe atmospheric heating
- Communications blackout

So it goes without saying that this can be a real pain in the ass. For a planet like Mars you really get the worst of everything:

##### Intro
- [[landing types]]
- [[non-thrusting entry terms ]]
- [[equations of motion for re-entry]]
- [[atmospheric model for re-entry]]

##### Ballistic re-entry 
- [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry]]
- [[ballistic coefficient]]
- [[vehicle shape and ballistic coefficient]]
- [[ballistic entry velocity equation]]
- [[ballistic entry time equation]]
- [[ballistic entry maximum deceleration equation]]
- [[ballistic entry max heating equation]]
- [[re-entry corridor]]

##### Lifting re-entry
The math's seems far more vague? I think for this one we just need to understand the general properties and not so much the details?
- [[lifting entry velocity equations]] UNFINISHED
- [[lifting entry cross range]]
- [[lifting entry paths]]

##### Additional challenges of EDL
- [[heat management in EDL]]
- [[entry radio blackout]]
- [[challenge of designing for re-entry]]
