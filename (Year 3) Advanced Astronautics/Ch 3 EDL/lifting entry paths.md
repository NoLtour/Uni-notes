## Lifting entry paths

### Generic characteristics

As you'd expect lifting re-entry has a much more gradual path than [[lifting re-entry and ballistic re-entry|ballistic re-entry]]:

The vehicle must glide in such a way to prevent overheating or excessive g-forces, (a [[re-entry corridor]]).

### Aerobraking

We don't always want land, if the goal is to be captured by a planet then we can simply use the atmosphere to reduce our velocity without the use of propellant and then enter a orbit. This is aerobraking:

It's more an extra-terrestrial method. Aerobraking may occur over multiple passes.
