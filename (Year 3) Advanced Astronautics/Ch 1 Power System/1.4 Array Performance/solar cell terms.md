## Solar cell terms

![[curve-iv-410551524.gif]]

Open voltage ($V_{OC}$) - Open circuit voltage, the max voltage you can measure across a solar cell, it's where there is an open circuit so current is zero
Short current ($I_{SC}$) - Short circuit current, the max current that can be measured across a solar cell, this is where the cell is shorted causing voltage to be zero
