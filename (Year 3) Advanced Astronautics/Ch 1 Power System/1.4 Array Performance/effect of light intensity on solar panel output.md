## Effect of light intensity on solar panel output

### Current, voltage and power

As you'd expect there is a reduction in maximum power output as the intensity of the incident light decreases:

- Current reduces approximately proportionally to light intensity
- Voltage (open circuit) reduces slightly but not significantly
- So max potential power output reduces approximately linearly with sun intensity

### Efficiency

(Note that in LEO solar flux is approximately 1400W/m^2)

This explains the result seen in total power output, since efficiency only experiences significant changes at below 1/4th the intensity in LEO the total power output with solar flux is approximately proportional to this limit.
