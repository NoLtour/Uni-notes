## Effect of shadows on solar panel output

Unlike the [[effect of light intensity on solar panel output]], where all panels experience the same drop shadows create a unique problem:

Here shadows create localised output drops, [[effect of light intensity on solar panel output|creating voltage drops, especially in the complete shadow case]]. Which can cause significant issues even with the use of bypass diodes:

Using bypass diodes in the following configuration can lessen this impact, but regardless it will still be there:

Small shadows are likely the result of the spacecraft's own structure casting shadows on itself.
