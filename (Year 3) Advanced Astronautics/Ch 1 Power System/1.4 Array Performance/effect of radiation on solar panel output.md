## Effect of radiation on solar panel output

By selecting the correct [[effect of temperature on solar panel output|temperature coefficient reference temp]] it's possible to model the impact of degradation simply by changing the coefficient's.

It should be noted that the exact current/voltage/power changes observed vary by material:
- Silicon cells experience identical degradation between [[solar cell terms|open circuit voltage]] and max power output
- GaAs cells experience different degradation between [[solar cell terms|open circuit voltage]] and max power output due variation in current out
