## Battery technical design

1. Determine the number of series cells required to meet the voltage requirement.
2. Determine the ampere-hour discharge required to meet the load current demand.
3. For the required number of charge/discharge cycles, determine the maximum allowable depth of discharge.
4. The total ampere-hour capacity of battery is determined by dividing the ampere-hour discharge required by the
allowable depth of discharge
5. Determine the number of battery pack required in parallel for the total ampere-hour capacity from packaging and
other considerations
6. Determine the temperature rise and the thermal control requirement
7. Determine the required charge and discharge rate controls
