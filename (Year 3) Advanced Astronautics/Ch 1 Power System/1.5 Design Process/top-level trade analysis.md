## Top-level trade analysis

### Definition
In spacecraft engineering, a top-level trade analysis refers to the high-level evaluation and comparison of various design options or trade-offs to make informed decisions about the key aspects of a spacecraft's design. This analysis occurs early in the spacecraft design process and involves assessing different technologies, components, and configurations to determine the most suitable approach for achieving mission objectives while considering constraints such as budget, weight, power, and mission requirements.

During a top-level trade analysis, engineers and mission planners explore different trade-offs related to various subsystems such as propulsion, communication, power, thermal control, sensors, and scientific instruments. They consider factors like performance, cost, schedule, and risks associated with each option.

For example, in the context of propulsion systems, engineers might compare different propulsion technologies (chemical propulsion, ion propulsion, etc.) based on their efficiency, thrust capabilities, and specific mission requirements. Similarly, in the context of scientific instruments, trade-offs might involve choosing between different types of sensors based on their sensitivity, resolution, and power consumption.
