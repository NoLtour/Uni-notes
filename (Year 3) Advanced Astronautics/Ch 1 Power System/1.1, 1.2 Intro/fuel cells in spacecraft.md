Fuel cells are often used instead of [[batteries in spacecraft|batteries]] especially for high power short missions as [[primary and secondary power system|primary power systems]]. 

One of the best thing's about fuel cells is the consistent operating voltage:

There is very little variance, allowing certain configurations without power regulators. (it's a near perfect [[constant voltage source]] if it has fuel)
