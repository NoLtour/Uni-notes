# 1.1 Power systems overview

#### Intro and contents
It's kind of obvious but without a power system everything is screwed, if you loose power for even a fraction of a second you could have instruments break or your computer fail. So for most applications it is critical that a desirable voltage and current can be supplied at all times! For this reason you can see that the power system is easily one of the most critical.
