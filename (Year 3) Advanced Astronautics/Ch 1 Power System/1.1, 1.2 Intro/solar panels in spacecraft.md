## Solar in spacecraft
### General layout
This is the most widely used [[primary and secondary power system|primary power system]] due to it's price, ease of handling and mission lifetime flexibility. Of course a big disadvantage is that in most cases you'll need some [[primary and secondary power system|secondoary power system]] usually [[batteries in spacecraft|batteries]] as well as  [[shunts and dump loads in spacecraft|shunts]]  to divert excess power maintaining the desired voltage.
