## Shunts and dump loads in spacecraft
In spacecraft electrical systems, shunts and dump loads play a crucial role in maintaining the target voltage. 

- Shunts are devices that divert excess electrical current away from the main system, regulating the flow to prevent overcharging of batteries or other components. 
- Dump loads, on the other hand, are resistive loads that dissipate excess power as heat when the electrical system generates more energy than needed.

 By strategically using shunts and dump loads, engineers can balance the electrical load and prevent voltage fluctuations. This balance is essential for ensuring that the spacecraft's systems operate within the desired voltage range. By diverting or dissipating excess power, these components help maintain a stable voltage, safeguarding sensitive electronic equipment and ensuring the spacecraft functions optimally during various mission phases.
