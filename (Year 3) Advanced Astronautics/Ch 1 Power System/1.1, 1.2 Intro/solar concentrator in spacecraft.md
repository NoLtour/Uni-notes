## Solar concentrator in spacecraft

Fundamentally we use heat to generate steam and drive a rotating turbo-generator or reciprocating alternator (thermodynamic energy converter).

- Generally these are about double the efficiency of a [[solar panels in spacecraft|photovoltaic cell]] approach, which means you can operate a smaller deployed structure reducing mass, price and [[space drag]]. 
- Less susceptible to degradation than solar from radiation

With all these benefits we should use them everywhere! But of course there is a reason we don't, there's not much development of turbines in space. Not having gravity has significant practical implications which has greatly limited introduction of risky techs such as this. ([[space risk problem]])
