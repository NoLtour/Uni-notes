## Initial estimation of sub system mass

When starting subsystem design you need some ballpark idea of how large certain systems should probably be... we engineers are quite good at this and have determined a perfect and accurate method, we call it [[guessing|(source I made it the fuck up)]].

### Power subsystem

This is a elegant empirical scaling law can be used to give a rough idea of mass:

Voltage can also be estimated using [[selection of system voltage|spacecraft bus voltage selection chart]].
