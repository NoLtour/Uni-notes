## Space drag
### Drag in SPACE?!
"Space drag" isn't the technical term, but basically even in [[obit selection|LEO]] there is drag. Which adds up over the long missions we do, there are additional effects which start to come into place even in [[obit selection|GEO]]. 

These effects are the culmination of everything listed below, what's most prominent varies depending on your region of space. But the common factor linking most of em is surface area, large area's tend to be acted on leading to destabilising effects.

### Common causes
thank you chat gpt

#### Solar Radiation Pressure:
- Solar photons exert pressure on satellite surfaces.
- Causes a gradual increase in the semi-major axis of the orbit.
- Significantly affects satellites with large surface areas, such as solar panels.

#### Solar Wind:
- Stream of charged particles (plasma) emitted by the Sun.
- Induces drag and can perturb satellite orbits.
- More pronounced in higher altitudes and during periods of solar activity.

#### Atmospheric Drag (in LEO):
- Interaction with the residual atmosphere at low Earth altitudes.
- Causes orbital decay due to friction between satellite and air molecules.
- Drag increases with lower altitudes and can lead to re-entry if not countered.

#### Gravitational Perturbations:
- Influence from the Moon, Sun, and other celestial bodies.
- Leads to secular changes in orbital elements over time.
- Requires precise orbit determination to maintain satellite positions.

#### Micrometeoroid Impact:
- Tiny meteoroids in space can collide with satellites.
- Causes surface erosion and potential damage to sensitive components.
- Materials and shielding designed to withstand micrometeoroid impacts.

#### Geomagnetic Storms:
- Disturbances in Earth's magnetic field caused by solar activity.
- Induces electrical currents in satellites, potentially damaging electronics.
- Can affect satellite orientation and communication systems.

#### Space Debris:
- Man-made debris in orbit around Earth.
- Poses collision risk to operational satellites.
- Requires active debris mitigation strategies to ensure satellite safety.
- Not really a kinematic issue, since the effects more likely to just break everything lmao
