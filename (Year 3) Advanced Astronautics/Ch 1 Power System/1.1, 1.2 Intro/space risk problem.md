## Space risk problem
I call this the "space risk problem", basically: 
- It costs a shit tone to send stuff into space and the components of satellites are expensive
- If something doesn't work you are critically fucked
- Sending untested tech into space could lead to mission failure
- Stick with what works!

All industries suffer from this sort of issue to some extent, but in space it can be especially exaggerated especially since everything sent up there's not easily accessible to fix any issues that pop up.
