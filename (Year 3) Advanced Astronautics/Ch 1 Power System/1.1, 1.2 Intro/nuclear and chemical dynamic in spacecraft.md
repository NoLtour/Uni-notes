## Nuclear and chemical dynamic in spacecraft
For short missions chemical fuel may be used instead of nuclear fuel.

These produce HUGE amounts of power, but suffer from many of the same issues [[nuclear thermoelectric in space|RTGs]] have. They require some sort of mechanical system:
- Stirling cycle (50W to 50kW)
- [[Brayton cycle]] (50kW to 100kW)

Due to the limited development of turbines in zero gravity these suffer from the [[space risk problem]].
