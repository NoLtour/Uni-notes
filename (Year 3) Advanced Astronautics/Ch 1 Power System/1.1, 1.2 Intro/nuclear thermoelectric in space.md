## Nuclear thermoelectric in space

RTGGGGGSSS!!! ([[rtgs are the bomb though not litterally|I love these things]])

These absolute units make use of some decaying radioactive material (eg plutonium) to generate heat, then using a [[thermoelectric generator]] between the heat source and the cooling radiator fins produce a consistent power output. 
- They can produce power anywhere, possibly eliminating the need for a [[primary and secondary power system|secondoary power system]]
- Note they depend on a temperature gradient, so the fins need to be able to dissipate the heat meaning there is some potential for output variance depending on the environment (with output increasing in colder environments)
- They produce radiation, meaning sensitive components may need additional shielding 
- Sources are really expensive, say 10 million $ per kg and can be difficult to handle both physically and legally

These tend do be used in medium power demand situations, with particular popularity in the outer solar system where [[solar panels in spacecraft]] are unviable.
