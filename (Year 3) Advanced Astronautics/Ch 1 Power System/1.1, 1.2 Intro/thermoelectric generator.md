## Thermoelectric generator
A thermoelectric generator (TEG) is a device that converts heat energy directly into electrical power using the [[Seebeck effect]]. It relies on the temperature difference between its two sides to create an electric current. When one side of the TEG is heated and the other side is kept cool, a voltage difference is generated, driving an electric current through connected conductors. TEGs find applications in situations where there's a temperature gradient, such as in waste heat recovery, remote power generation, and space missions, providing a compact and reliable source of electricity without moving parts.
