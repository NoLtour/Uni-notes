## Spacecraft electrical bus

In spacecraft electrical systems, a bus refers to a main power distribution network that carries electrical energy from the power source (such as solar panels or batteries) to various subsystems and components within the spacecraft. The bus acts as a central hub, regulating and distributing power to different systems, including propulsion, communication, scientific instruments, and life support. It ensures that the electrical energy is efficiently utilized and distributed, enabling the spacecraft's proper functioning during different mission phases, such as launch, orbit, and scientific operations.
