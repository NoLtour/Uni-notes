## The Paschen minimum
TL;DR: Paschen minimum is the optimal gap between conductors to prevent sparking in low-pressure environments like space, ensuring safe and reliable electrical insulation.

The Paschen minimum refers to the minimum breakdown voltage required for electrical insulation between two conductors in a gas at low pressure. Specifically, the Paschen minimum for bare conductors occurs when the gap between the conductors is optimized for the gas pressure and composition, resulting in the lowest voltage at which electrical breakdown (or arcing) can occur. 

This phenomenon is crucial in various applications, including spacecraft and high-voltage equipment, where maintaining a certain gap between conductors is essential to prevent unintended electrical discharges.
