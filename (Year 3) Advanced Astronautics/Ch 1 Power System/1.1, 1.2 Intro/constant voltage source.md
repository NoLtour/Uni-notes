## Constant voltage source
A constant voltage source provides a stable, unchanging voltage output regardless of the current flowing through it or changes in the load. It maintains a consistent voltage level, ensuring a reliable and steady power supply for connected devices or circuits.

Practically there is no such thing as a PERFECT [[constant voltage source]], but things like [[fuel cells in spacecraft|fuel cells]] get pretty damn close.
