### String
A solar cell string is a series of connected solar cells in a photovoltaic module. String length determines [[potential difference]] across string.

These cells are electrically wired together in a specific sequence, generating a higher voltage output when exposed to sunlight. Strings are then combined in solar panels to create the desired power output for various applications, such as in solar farms or residential installations.

### Array
A solar cell array is just [[solar layout terms|solar cell string]]s in parallel. If you consider that cells have a specific current output at each voltage then it becomes clear to increase to total current output of an array at some specific voltage you'll have to increase the number of them in parallel (hence array size controls current).
