# 1.3 Photovoltaic-Battery System Overview

#### Intro and content
Basically this is going into detail on [[solar panels in spacecraft]].
Stacking solar cells in series allows you to control the total potential across the [[solar layout terms|string]], which means you can just use a string to get the target voltage and BOOM no need for regulators! Till you remember that [[maximising solar power out#Effect of conditions|solar output can change for lots of reasons]], so practically your going to need some sort of voltage regulator... and [[mfw this is getting complicated just use a RTG|probably]] a battery.
