## Spacecraft power system architectures

### Direct energy transfer (DET)

In spacecraft power system architectures, Direct Energy Transfer (DET) refers to a design where power generated by solar panels is directly supplied to loads, with no complex electronics in-between. So there may still be:
- Slip rings (to transfer power from rotating panels to main bus)
- Power distribution unit consisting of load switching relays and fuses to protect the power system from faults in the load circuits.

#### Types of DET

##### Unregulated bus

An unregulated bus supplies power from solar panels directly to spacecraft systems without voltage or current stabilization. Simple and lightweight, but susceptible to fluctuations, it lacks consistency under varying solar conditions.

##### Fully regulated bus

A fully regulated bus employs electronic components like voltage regulators, ensuring stable power supply to spacecraft systems. Protects electronics from voltage spikes, providing a reliable and constant power source regardless of solar fluctuations.

##### Sunlight regulated bus

A sunlight regulated bus optimizes power generation by adjusting solar panels and dynamically managing power consumption based on changing sunlight conditions. Maximizes energy harvesting, making it ideal for missions with variable sunlight exposure.

This is kind of in-between unregulated and fully regulated.

### Peak power tracker (PPT)

PPT makes use of voltage converters (such as transformers) to ensure that the power supplied to the bus is at maximum. This is achieved by operating solar cells near [[maximising solar power out#Current/Voltage draw|their max power output]]:

Total power to the bus is the result of:
$$(\text{power from solar})\times(\text{losses in transformers}) = (\text{power to bus})$$
So there may be a value below/above "ideal solar current draw" which provides greater power to the bus due to the trade-offs in power conversion!

Hence to achieve peak power production "The power loss in the PPT converter must is  less than the gain in operating the system at the peak power point all the time"
