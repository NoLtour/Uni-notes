## Euclidian space
Euclidean space is a three-dimensional, flat space described by classical geometry, where distances are measured using the Pythagorean theorem. It adheres to principles like parallel lines not intersecting and angles of a triangle adding up to 180 degrees. Euclidean space is fundamental in classical mathematics and physics.

Basically this is the space we exist in[[this asterisk scares me|*]], it's what we've been using in geometry since primary school. Each axis is independent and straight.
