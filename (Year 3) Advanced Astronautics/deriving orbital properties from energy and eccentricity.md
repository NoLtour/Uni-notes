## Deriving orbital properties from energy and eccentricity

We can actually fully define the orbit from just the [[specific orbital moment of momentum|orbital angular momentum]] and [[eccentricity vector]].

The first quantity to find is [[specific orbital energy]], it is trivial:

$$\begin{align*}
\varepsilon =  -\frac{ \mu  }{ r_{a}  +  r_{p}  } = - \frac{\mu}{2a}= - \frac{\mu^{2}}{2h^{2}}(1 - e^{2})
\end{align*}$$

Then the [[ellipse (year 2)|semi-major axis]] obviously becomes equally trivial:

$$\begin{align*}
\varepsilon &=  - \frac{\mu}{2a} &&\to& a &=  - \frac{\mu}{2\varepsilon}
\end{align*}$$

With that done, [[ellipse (year 2)|semi-minor axis]] is quite easy:

$$\begin{align*}
e&= \sqrt{1- \frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}} &&\to& \sqrt{(e^{2} - 1)a^{2}}  &=  b 
\end{align*}$$

With that, the 2D orbit is fully defined. But the 3D properties that define the orbital plane need to be found ([[orbital inclination|inclination]], [[orbital right ascension|right ascension]] ect). These can be found from the vectors.
