## Newtons second law in non inertial frame

[[Newtons second law]] only applies in an [[inertial frame of reference]]. It is possible to adjust it to function for a [[non-inertial frame]] by introducing an imaginary force.

>> where:
>> $\vec{x}=$ The moving objects position (in the [[non-inertial frame]]) 
>> $\vec{x}_{f}=$ The position of the [[non-inertial frame]] relative to an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]
>> $\vec{F}=$ A force acting on the object (in the [[non-inertial frame]]) 
>> $m=$ The mass of the moving object

We often describe this additional term ($m \ddot{\vec{x}}_{f}$) as a "fictitious force", it is an imaginary force acting proportional and opposite to the "absolute" acceleration of the reference frame.

Consider that we treat the inside of a vehicle moving at constant speed as an inertial frame, constant speed means that $\ddot{x}_{f}=0$ hence:
$$\begin{align*}
m\ddot{\vec{x}}  &=  \left[ \sum\limits\vec{F}(s) \right] - m \ddot{\vec{x}}_{f} & &\to & m\ddot{\vec{x}}  &=   \sum\limits\vec{F}(s) 
\end{align*}$$

Of course if the inertial frame is static, then the same relationship is found. In this way any frame which has __no acceleration__ can be used as an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]].
