## Astronautical reference frames

Reference frame is critically important when observing orbits, for most of history we took the Earth to be the centre that everything moves about. When we did that the paths of other celestial bodies where extremely complex:

By making use of the thing being orbited (the sun) being the centre, we greatly simplified planetary motion and determined the true state of the solar system. Of course in cases where the Earth is the centre (such as LEO) an Earth reference frame is used.
