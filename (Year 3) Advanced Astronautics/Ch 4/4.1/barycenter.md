## Barycenter

Although [[3D gravitational attraction]] in isolation isn't all that complicated, trying to derive orbits from it is. This is where the [[barycenter]] comes in, it's not all that complicated though. Simply put it is the centre of mass of two objects:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \vec{x}_{cm}  &=  \frac{m_{1} \vec{x}_{1} + m_{2} \vec{x}_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\vec{x}_{cm}=$ [[barycenter]] vector
>> $\vec{x}=$ position vector
>> $m=$ mass

The useful reason we define this, is this is the point that a 2 body problem will orbit around.
