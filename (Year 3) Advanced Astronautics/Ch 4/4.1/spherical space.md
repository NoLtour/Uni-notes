## Spherical space

TL;DR: Euclidean geometry works in flat space, but in curved space, like that of a sphere, Euclidean properties don't always apply. In spherical space, the shortest path between two points is a curved line, not a straight one. Questions arise about the uniqueness of this path, intersections of different lines, and the behavior of parallel lines. Understanding geometry in curved space is crucial in fields like orbital mechanics and astronomy.
