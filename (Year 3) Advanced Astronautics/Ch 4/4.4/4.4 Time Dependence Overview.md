# 4.4 Time Dependence Overview

#### Intro and contents

In all working so far, we've ignored time. Any working that had it included made use of:

$$\begin{align*}
\dot{\theta} &= \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{h}{r^{2}}
\end{align*}$$

Doing so allows the removal of complex angular velocity terms making working simpler, but this means so far we have no method for determining the time between two points in an orbit. This set of note's addresses that.
