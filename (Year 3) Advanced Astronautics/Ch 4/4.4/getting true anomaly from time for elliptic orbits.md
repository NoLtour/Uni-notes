## Getting true anomaly from time for elliptic orbits (Keplerâ€™s equation)

Through careful rearrangement of [[time integral for orbital motion]], it becomes possible to derive a form of the equation that can be used to get true anomaly! (This is specifically for the [[orbit categories by eccentricity|elliptical case]])

It is far more convenient to work with this form of the equation then translate back into $\theta$! 

As for the actual geometric meaning of the translation, what's effectively being done is translating the elliptical form into an "equivalent" circular form:

#### Quadrant ambiguity $\left(E=  2\arctan\left( \sqrt{\frac{1-e}{1+e}} \tan \frac{\theta}{2} \right)\right)$

Consider the form of the equation of [[time integral for orbital motion|eccentric anomaly]], does it suffer from [[quadrant disambiguation]]?

For all value's of $E$ and $\theta$ there is a unique solution! So this is easy to handle and doesn't require special consideration. The only thing that must be considered is that most calculators return value's between $- \frac{\pi}{2}\to \frac{\pi}{2}$ but for orbital mechanics notation dictates $0\to 2\pi$, so it should be translated when appropriate.

#### Quadrant ambiguity $\left(e\sin E =  \frac{e\sqrt{1-e^{2}}\sin\theta}{1+e\cos\theta}\right)$

Consider this form of the equation of [[time integral for orbital motion|eccentric anomaly]], does it suffer from [[quadrant disambiguation]]?

When plotted we can see that $cos$ will not return a unique inverse, the same obviously also applies to $\sin$. So when considering this part of the equation consideration of the real world implications can be used to aid [[quadrant disambiguation]].
