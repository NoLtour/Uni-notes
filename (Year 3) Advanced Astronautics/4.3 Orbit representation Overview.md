# 4.3 Orbit representation Overview

#### Intro and contents
A significant issue when working in space is choosing an appropriate coordinate frame to work in, the coordinate frame is essentially just a consequence of what we choose as reference points.
- For an "Earth centred, Earth fixed" reference frame, it's useful for geosats and ground stations, but with Earths rotation is horrible for most satellites
- Then there is "Earth centred, Sun pointing", where the rotation of the axis every year can be annoying though has utility for solar panels or telescopes

There are lots of potential coordinate sytems, but if we want one that is "static" we'll need stationary refrence points
