# 2.1 Thermal Control System intro Overview

#### Intro
Since this is just a intro, I'm [[absolute pandamonium|shaking up the format]].

We've touched on this a lot, so I'll keep it brief:
- All equipment has required temperature ranges for operation
- All equipment can break outside of a certain range

The [[spacecraft heat balance#Heat inputs and outputs|sources of heat]] are broad and annoying:
- Solar
- Albedo
- Electronics
- Engines

Then there are other annoying factors:
- Long term radiation exposure can change [[total radiation absorption transmittance and reflectance|absorptance]] and [[total radiation absorption transmittance and reflectance|reflectance]] values
- Eclipses, can get real complex with non-circular orbits and multiple moons
- Distance from sun
- Spacecraft geometry and rotation
- Thermal gradients
- Orbit requirements for the mission could make thermal management especially difficult
- Space oxygen and micrometeorites can change thermal properties

Something to keep in mind is the thermal system is fundamentally reliant extremal surfaces, as is the nature of radiation emission and absorption. This direct exposure to vacuum of space means the impact of radiation, micrometeorites, off gassing and space oxygen, require extra attention.

All this paired with the [[spacecraft maintenance problem]] make it a real joy.
