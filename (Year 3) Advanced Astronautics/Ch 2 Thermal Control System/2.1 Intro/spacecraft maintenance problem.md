## Spacecraft maintenance problem

This is a [[humanity students be like|made up]] term, by the source of these notes: [[if you do not like it then fucking seeth|me]].

I use this to refer to a critical issue facing spacecraft: We can't fix em.

Which means we need to be able to put a [[a technical term|space-robot]] (spacecraft) into the most diverse, hostile and alien (literally) environments known. Then not only must it work perfectly, it must continue to work for years or even decades.

This problem becomes especially fun once you consider that often you are launching vehicles which are unique, each being made to order on top of the fact that you may only have a single shot at the mission.
