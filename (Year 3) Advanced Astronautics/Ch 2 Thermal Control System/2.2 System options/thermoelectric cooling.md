## Thermoelectric cooling

Think of these as solid state refrigerators.

Thermoelectric cooling is a technology that uses the Peltier effect to create a heat flux between two different materials. When an electric current passes through a junction of these materials, it either absorbs heat at one end (cooling) or releases heat at the other end (heating). This cooling method is solid-state, meaning it has no moving parts, making it compact and reliable. However, it's less efficient than traditional refrigeration systems and is often used for small-scale cooling applications.
