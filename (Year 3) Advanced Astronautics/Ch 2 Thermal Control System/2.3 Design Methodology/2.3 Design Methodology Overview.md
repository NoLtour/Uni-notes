# 2.3 Design Methodology Overview

#### Intro and contents

![[Pasted image 20231031172042.png]]

The challenge of designing a thermal control system is daunting but approachable. Here is a outline of one approach:  
1) All components must be characterised:
	- Acceptable component temperature ranges are established
	- Constrains on temperatures will require consultation of all other spacecraft engineering groups
2) Establish thermal boundary conditions for the mission:
	- Get environment conditions and orientation; how they vary with time (mission progression) from the mission analysis group
	- Considerations on sensor usage and the thermal implications
	- Get power considerations, for power availability and critically component-use heat generation
3) Start design using appropriate analytical tools
