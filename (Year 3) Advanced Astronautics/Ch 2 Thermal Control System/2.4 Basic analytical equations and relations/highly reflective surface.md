## Highly reflective surface

![[Pasted image 20221230185124.png]]

Highly reflective surfaces especially metallic ones tend to have:
- High [[real body emission|emittance]]
- Low [[total radiation absorption transmittance and reflectance|absorptance]]

Which can be useful, but also problematic if the goal is to dissipate heat. This is where [[optical solar reflector]]s come in.
