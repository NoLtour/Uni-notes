## Selective surfaces
 
Selective surfaces in spacecraft are materials or coatings engineered to have different absorptivity and emissivity values in the solar wave band (visible and near-infrared) and the infrared wave band. 

By using these surfaces, spacecraft can regulate temperature, prevent overheating, and maintain thermal stability in the harsh conditions of space.


For example:
- Maximise the absorption of solar energy (high [[solar absorptivity]]) 
- Minimize the emission of heat in the form of infrared radiation (low [[infrared emissivity]]). 

Here we would get a surface that would be naturally hot when exposed to sunlight.
