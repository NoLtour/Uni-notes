## Useful spacecraft surface characteristics

### Defs

#### Solar absorptivity ($\alpha_{s}$)

The mean average value of absorptivity over the solar wave band.

#### Infrared emissivity ($\varepsilon_{IR}$)

Mean average value of emissivity over the IR wave band. 

In reality [[real body emission|emissivity]] is a function of temperature, but typically it takes hundreds of degrees for there to be a significant change in value from it's room temperature value. So we can approximate it with a constant.

### Utility

Since most spacecraft surfaces emit in the IR spectrum, we can approximate their emissions over a reasonable range of temperatures using [[useful spacecraft surface characteristics|infrared emissivity]]. Likewise [[useful spacecraft surface characteristics|solar absorptivity]] can be used to get the abortion of solar radiation.

Hence it's obvious that these material properties are critical when attempting to optimise for [[active and passive thermal control|passive thermal control]]!
