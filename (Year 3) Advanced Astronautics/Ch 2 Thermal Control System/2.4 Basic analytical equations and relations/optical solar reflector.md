## Optical solar reflector

This is a type of [[selective surfaces|selective surface]] which is designed to produce the lowest possible temperature under solar energy:
- Minimize the absorption of solar energy (low [[solar absorptivity]]) 
- Maximise the emission of heat in the form of infrared radiation (high [[infrared emissivity]]). 

To achieve this they generally use have:
- Substrate with a highly reflective surface, reflects radiation outwards
- Overlaid with a transparent cover, emits IR radiation and transmits it, creating a 3D emission "surface" rather than a 2D one

The thickness of the transparent cover can have problematic weight implications which must be considered.
