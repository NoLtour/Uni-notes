## Kirchhoff's law

For an arbitrary body emitting and absorbing thermal radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium, the [[real body emission|emissivity]] is equal to the [[total radiation absorption transmittance and reflectance|absorptivity]]:

$$\begin{align*}
\varepsilon &= \alpha
\end{align*}$$

This only applies when the bodies only means of heat change is emission and absorption.
