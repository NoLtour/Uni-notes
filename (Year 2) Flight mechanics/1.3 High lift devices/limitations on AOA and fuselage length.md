## Limitations on AOA and fuselage length

This is awesome, we can just keep increasing $C_{Lmax}$ till the take off requirements are met! That is until you realise that to reach $C_{Lmax}$ you need a high AOA, and this thing called an aircraft body exists:

Ok so the next solution is to shorten the body? Well no, because a longer and slender aircraft body actually decreases parasitic drag:

Optimising the tail shape can reclaim some angle of attack, but ultimately, a trade-off between take-off speed and fuselage drag penalty will need to be made.
