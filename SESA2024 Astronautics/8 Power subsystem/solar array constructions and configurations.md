## Solar array constructions and configurations
### External configuration examples
So so so many factors effect choice of configuration hence there are lots to choose from:

### Wiring
As discussed in [[maximising solar power out|effect of current/voltage draw on solar efficiency]], the current/voltage is very important in maximising efficiency. A very common method for managing this is making use of series and parrallel wiring to achieve closer to the optimum outputs:

### Array construction
A solar array is much more complex than just slapping a bunch of cells together:

Wiring, protective glass, structural materials ect are all needed to create something usful.
