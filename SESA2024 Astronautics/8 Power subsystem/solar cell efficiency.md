## Solar cell efficiency ($\eta$)

This is simply the measure of the solar power in vs electrical power out for some given solar panel:

> ### $$ \eta P_{in} = P_{out} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\eta=$ [[solar cell efficiency]]
>> $P_{in}=$ solar power in
>> $P_{out}=$ electrical power out

Typically it's in the range of $0.1 \to 0.3$ depending on a range of factors such as material, temp, sun indicende angle, radiation degradation ect. With most of these being discussed in [[maximising solar power out]].
