## specific orbital [[moment of linear momentum|moment of momentum]] ($\underline{h}$)
The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]] of the relative position vector $\underline{r}$ and the relative velocity vector $\underline{V}$. (the orbital [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]] per unit mass)

>> $\underline{V}=$ velocity vector
>> $\underline{r}=$ position vector of orbiting satellite.

Alternatively written using the same format from [[tangential and radial acceleration in orbital motion]]:

> ## $$ |\underline{h}| = r \frac{d\theta}{dt} = r \omega = |\underline{r}\times \underline{V}| $$

>> $\underline{h}=$ [[specific orbital moment of momentum|specific orbital angular momentum]]
>> $\omega=$ [[rigid body rotation around a fixed axis|angular velocity]]

Something very useful about this is that as the satellite orbits the value of $\underline{h}$ remains constant, it applies when the following conditions are met:
- No forces act on the body other than gravity
- Both objects can be treated as spherically symmetrical point masses
- The satellite has significantly less mass than the body it orbits
