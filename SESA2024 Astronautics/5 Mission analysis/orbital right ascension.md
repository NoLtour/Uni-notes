## Orbital right ascension ($\Omega$)

The orbital right of ascension of the ascending node is the angle between the [[first point of aries]] (a static([[I REALLY hate these measurement systems|ish]]) reference line) and the [[ascending node]]. We can see that the [[first point of aries]] is a static refrence as the planet orbits around the sun:

Then the [[ascending node]] describes the satellites orbit
