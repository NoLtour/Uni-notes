## Orbital mean motion ($n$)

If you look at the orbital period equation from [[keplers laws of orbital motion]]:
!![[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8]]
You can see that taking $a$ and $\mu$ ($\mu=MG$) to be constant will give you $\tau$ equal to a constant, this clearly shows that the orbital period is the same regardless of [[ellipse|minor axis]]:

This is also the reason behind the definition of [[orbital mean motion]],

>> $\tau=$ [[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8|orbital period]]
