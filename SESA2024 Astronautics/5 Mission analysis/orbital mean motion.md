## Orbital mean motion ($n$)

If you look at the orbital period equation from [[keplers laws of orbital motion]]:
!![[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8]]
You can see that taking $a$ and $\$

> ## $$ n = \frac{2\pi}{\tau} $$ 
>> where:
>> $n=$ [[orbital mean motion]]
>> $\tau=$ [[keplers laws of orbital motion#^e855e8|orbital period]]
