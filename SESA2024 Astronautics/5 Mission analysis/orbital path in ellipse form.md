## Orbital path in ellipse form

Using maths wizardry you can take the stuff from [[specific orbital moment of momentum|specific orbital angular momentum]] and [[tangential and radial acceleration in orbital motion]] to get the following equation:

> ## $$ r = \frac{h^{2}}{\mu(1+E\cos\theta)} $$ 
> ## $$ \mu = r^{3}\dot{\theta}^{2} - \ddot{r}r^{2}  $$
>> where:
>> $h^{2}=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$
