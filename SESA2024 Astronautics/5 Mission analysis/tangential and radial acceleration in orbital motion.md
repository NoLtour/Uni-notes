## Tangential and radial acceleration in orbital motion

If we describe the motion of a body relative to some origin in terms of radius and angle, in the following convention:

Then it is possible to describe the bodies cartesian acceleration in the tangential and radial direction (relative to some origin). I'm not going through the steps to get there because it's unneeded and painful to type so here is what you'd get:

> ### $$ a_{j} = 2 \dot{{r}} \dot{\theta} + {r} \ddot{\theta} $$ 
> ### $$ a_{i} = \ddot{{r}} - {r} \dot{\theta}^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $a_{j}=$ tangential acceleration
>> $a_{i}=$ radial acceleration
>> ${r}=$ distance of body from origin
>> $\theta=$ angle between some static reference (on the plane of motion of the body) and the origin to the body
