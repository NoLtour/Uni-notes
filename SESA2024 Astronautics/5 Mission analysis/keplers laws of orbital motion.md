## Keplers laws of orbital motion

The laws are:
1) Planets orbit in [[ellipse]]s
2) Equal areas are swept in orbits in equal times
3) The square of the period of the planet is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the Sun

Since law 1 is [[it kinda is|obvious]] I'm only elaborating on 2 and 3.
