## Orbital elements

We know that orbits are ellipses, but for any practical calculation to occur we need a way to describe the shape/position of an orbit, which is what we do here. An orbit can be described using 6 elements:
- [[orbital right ascension]]
- [[orbital inclination]]
- [[orbital perigee]]
- [[orbital semi-major axis]]
- [[orbital eccentricity]]
