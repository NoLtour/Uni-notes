## Impulsive orbital transfers

When changing an orbit using an impulse it is impossible to achieve something such as the following:

Since for an impulsive manoeuvre it is obvious that the current position of the spacecraft will lie on the new orbital path and hence the new orbit must intercept the old orbit at least at the point where the burn occurs:

If the impulse acts in the direction of motion of the satellite then the orbit will only intercept it's previous orbit at the impulse point.
