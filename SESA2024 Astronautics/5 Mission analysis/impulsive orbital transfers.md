## Impulsive orbital transfers
It is common to make the assumption that a manovre is impulsive, which is often a resonable approximation given the relative time of an orbital period vs the engine burn time. This assumption doen't hold for low orbital periods relative to burn times such as:
- Using a long burn propulsion method such as [[ion thruster]]s.
- In a orbit with a short orbital period

### Outcomes of impulses
When changing an orbit using an impulse it is impossible to achieve something such as the following:

Since for an impulsive manoeuvre it is obvious that the current position of the spacecraft will lie on the new orbital path and hence the new orbit must intercept the old orbit at least at the point where the burn occurs:

If the impulse acts in the direction of motion of the satellite then the orbit will only intercept it's previous orbit at the impulse point. Of course in the case where the impulse does not act in the direction of motion you can get additional intercepts between the past and present orbit:

There is also the possibility of the impulse being sufficient to get the object on an escape trajectory but that's a future issue.
