## Ascending node
This is the point where a satellite orbiting the earth crosses the equator.

![[ascending-node-vector-graph-1316728098.png]]

In the diagram above a satellites orbital plane is marked out with a shaded in ellipse and the equatorial plane is represented using a grey plane. The intercept between these layers is where the ascending node lies, with the direction of the ascending node pointing here the satellite moves from below the equatorial plane to above it.
