## Orbital moment of momentum
The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]] of the relative position vector $\underline{r}$ and the relative velocity vector $\underline{V}$. (the orbital [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]] per unit mass)

Alternatively written using the same format from [[tangential and radial acceleration in orbital motion]]:

Something very useful about this is that as the satellite orbits the value of $\underline{h}$ remains constant, it applys when the following conditions are met:
- No forces act on the body other than gravity
- Both objects can be treated as spherically symmetrical point masses
- The satellite has significantly less mass than the body it orbits
