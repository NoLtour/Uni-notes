## Black and grey bodies

![[Pasted image 20221230144220.png]]

### Black bodies

These are bodies that absorb all [[radiation incidence behaviour|incident thermal radiation]], they only really exist in theory. Can be desciribed as an object with a constant [[radiation incidence behaviour|spectral absorptance]] equal to 1:

> ### $$ \alpha_{\lambda} = 1 $$

### Grey bodies

These are bodies that absorb the same [[radiation incidence behaviour|incident thermal radiation]] for all wavelengths, they only really exist in theory. Can be described as an object with a constant [[radiation incidence behaviour|spectral absorptance]] equal to something:

> ### $$ \alpha_{\lambda} = k $$
