## Spacecraft thermal control intro

### Heat transfer mechanisms
It's [[this is primary school shit right here|common knowledge]] that there are 3 ways for transferring heat:
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

Of course internally all 3 could transfer heat throughout the vehicle, but in terms of heat transfer between the craft and the environment (a deadly vacuum) convection and conduction aint going to be doing anything. In space the only thermal transfer mechanism worth noting is going to be radiation.

### Factors on thermal radiation

#### Environmental
There are actually quite a few possible sources of thermal radiation which does need to be considered:
- Direct emission from the sun.
- Solar radiation reflected off nearby objects, this is called the albedo.
- Thermal radiation, anything that isn't at absolute zero lets off black body radiation this includes the earth and also applys when the vehicles experiencing eclipse.

#### Vehicle
The spacecraft itself generates plenty of heat in operation:
- Inefficiency from electronics (batteries ect)
- Rocket firing
- Vehicle coating and geometry effects absorption properties

### Heat dissipation

The spacecraft is also a body that is not at absolute zero, so of course it radiates heat (this is how we cool the fucking thing). The spacecrafts geometry, coating and heat distrobution all effect the rate at which thermal energy is radiated which need to be carefully chosen to achieve the end goal of the thermal subsystem "thermal balance".
