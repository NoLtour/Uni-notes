## Thrust within an atmospheric environment

The [[the basic rocket equation|rocket equation]] is nice and all but it doesn't account for the effect of ambient pressure and how that interacts with the exhaust:

If we go get the thrust equation from [[the basic rocket equation|here]] we can account for the effect of  pressure:

If we imagine the exit of the nozzle as a flat plate where the internal pressure and external pressure meet, we can calculate the net force acting in the direction of motion from the pressure difference:
$$ P_{a} - P_{e} $$
A lower pressure inside the nozzle of course leads to a sort of vacuum effect which p
