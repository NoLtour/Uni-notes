## Bi propellant systems

### Description

A system that uses 2 substances, a fuel and an oxidiser to cause a reaction for thrust. The properties vary greatly depending on choice of oxidiser and fuel, here is a small selection of fuels and oxidizers:

Note that oxidizers with a \* are [[hypergolic]].
Many oxidisers and propellants sued in bi propellant systems require cryogenic cooling, which leads to greatly increased complexity.

The plumbing of bi propellant systems tends to be much more complex than [[mono propellant systems]].

### Attributes
- High [[specific impulse]] and thrust
- Increased plumbing complexity
- Increased complexity in storage
