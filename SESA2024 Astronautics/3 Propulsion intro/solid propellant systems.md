## Solid propellant systems
### Description
Comparatively simple propulsion device composed of solid fuel, an engine nozzle and an igniter:

The major problem with solid propellant systems is that once ignition starts it cannot be stopped or throttled, what can be done however is changing the geometry of the solid propellant to change the surface area change rate and hence the way it burns:

Very complex geometry's can be achieved using modern methods such as 3D printing.

These are often created out of repeating sections which are stacked to reduce manufacturing complexity:

### Properties
- Medium [[specific impulse]]
- High thrust
- Cannot be toggled, unsuitable for [[primary and secondary propulsion|secondary propulsion]]
- Very simple with no need for plumbing
- Not refuellable, this becomes increasingly relevant with the increase in reusable launch vehicles

As you can guess solid propellant systems are great for first stages as well as boosting satellites.
