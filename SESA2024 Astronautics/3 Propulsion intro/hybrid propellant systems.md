## Hybrid propellant systems
Basically this is what you get when a [[solid propellant systems|solid propellant system]] and a [[bi propellant systems|bi propellant system]] are mixed to produce some [[ungodly abomination]]. That being said this is actually quite cool, here the oxidiser or fuel is solid and the other is liquid, then by releasing the liquid into the solid the reaction can occur to produce thrust, allowing a controllable burn.

In terms of pro's and con's its just a hybrid of the two as would be expected:
- Medium [[specific impulse]]
- Controllable burn
- High thrust
- Reasonably simple plumbing
- Not reusable
