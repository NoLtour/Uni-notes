## Specific impulse

Specific impulse is a measure of how efficiently a reaction mass engine (a rocket using propellant or a jet engine using fuel) creates thrust. For engines whose reaction mass is only the fuel they carry, specific impulse is exactly proportional to the effective exhaust gas velocity.

> ### $$ I = \int^{t}_{0} T \cdot dt = \int^{t}_{0} V_{ex} \sigma \cdot dt $$
> ### $$ T = g_{0} I_{sp} \sigma $$

>> $I_{sp}=$ [[specific impulse]]
>> $K=$ a constant 
>> $\bar{M}=$ average molecular weight of exhaust gases
>> $T_{c}=$ combustion chamber temperature
>> $T=$ thrust
>> $I=$ impulse
>> $g_{0}=9.81=$ [[standard gravity]]
>> $V_{ex}=$ exhaust velocity
>> $M_{e}=$ mass exhausted
>> $\sigma=\frac{d{M}_{e}}{dt}=\dot{M}_{e}=$ exhaust flow rate 

Hence it can be seen that to increase $I_{sp}$:
- Increase exit velocity
- Increase combustion chamber pressure
- Increase mass floe rate
- Increase molecular weight of exhaust
