## Mono propellant systems

### Def

Ok this definition will take rocket science tier difficulty to understand. Mono propellant systems... are systems that produce thrust using a single propellant. ([[this is crazy|mind blown]]) The propellent can be reacted without the need of a separate fluid such as an oxidiser. 

### Example (hydrazine)

Hydrazine ($N_{2}H_{4}$) is a common mono propellant, the reaction to produce thrust is simple: the hydrazine enters a chamber containing a catalytic bed (made of platinum and iridium)
