## Mono propellant systems

### Description

Ok this definition will take rocket science tier difficulty to understand. Mono propellant systems... are systems that produce thrust using a single propellant. ([[this is crazy|mind blown]]) The propellent can be reacted without the need of a separate fluid such as an oxidiser. 

Traits:
- A single propellant makes plumbing simpler
- Tend to have a lower [[specific impulse]]
- Reduced combustion chamber complexity
- Often VERY toxic, so needs careful handling
- Low thrust, not suited for use as [[primary and secondary propulsion|primary propulsion]]

### Example (hydrazine)

Hydrazine ($N_{2}H_{4}$) is a common mono propellant, the reaction to produce thrust is simple: the hydrazine enters a chamber containing a catalytic bed (made of platinum and iridium) which causes the hydrazine to decompose into really hot ammonia and hydrogen gas which get expelled to produce thrust:

Hydrazine is [[I eat it every day|very safe]]; it is highly toxic, corrosive and flammable. All around a fun time, most mono propellants are because well highly unstable energy dense stuff makes good propellant lol.
