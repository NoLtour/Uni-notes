## Arcjet
This is a type of [[electrically propelled systems|electrically propelled system]]; passing a current through a gas, causing the gas to expand due to heating the energy is then used to increase the momentum of the gas as exhaust hence producing thrust. This requires 100's of amps of current and hence lots of power, relative to other [[electrically propelled systems]] these have high thrusts, the ISP is much higher than [[resistojet|resistojets]] but the burn duration is limited to hours at most since the anods and cathode get
