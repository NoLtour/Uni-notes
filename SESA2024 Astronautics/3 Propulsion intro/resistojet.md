## Resistojet
This is a type of [[electrically propelled systems|electrically propelled system]], here there is resistive heating of the propellant, to give it energy before it is accelerated through the nozzle. Heating the fluid from 1600o C to 2500o C (depending on the material of the element), by heating the propellant the momentum of the exhaust can be increased hence leading to performance benefits.

Thrust scales with the atomic mass of the propellant, so things such as Xenon, water and butane are used. This is cheap and offers much higher ISP than chemical [[bi propellant systems]], the trade off of course is low thrust making this only really practical in space.
