## Resistojet
This is a type of [[electrically propelled systems|electrically propelled system]], here there is resistive heating of the propellant, to give it energy before it is accelerated through the nozzle. Heating the fluid from 1600o C to 2500o C (depending on the material of the element), by heating the propellant the momentum of the exhaust can be increased hence leading to performance benefits.
