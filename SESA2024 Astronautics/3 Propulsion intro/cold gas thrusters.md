## Cold gas thrusters

This is where you just [[I mean what did you expect the meme here to be|shit out gas]] to produce thrust, simple but (inefficient) effective. Although both low thrust and low [[specific impulse]] since they can be pulsed and require very simple plumbing cold gas thrusters make effective [[primary and secondary propulsion|secondary propulsion]] for use in [[controllable external torquers|attitude control]].

Something important to note is that propellants are often chosen based on the effect of the exhaust plumes, such that they don't risk interfering with the sensors. The relatively low exhaust speed and position of gas thrusters often means that the effect of the gas on equipment needs to be considered.
