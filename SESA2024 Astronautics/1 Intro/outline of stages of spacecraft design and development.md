## Outline of stages of spacecraft design and development


![[Pasted image 20221006143446.png]]

### Breakdown of stages

#### Step 1: Defining the mission objectives
Customer/users of proposed spacecraft defines what the spacecraft needs to be able to do using a detailed specification including mission outline, possibly instrument requirements ect.
This contains specific quantitative requirements, not some child's doodle of a satellite saying "go past Saturn".

#### Step 2: Payload definition
- Preformed by a group of specialists in the relevant fields.
- Elaborate on the mission objectives to create a mission objective defined according to specific observations, instrument/sensor requirements.
- Essentially this is the part where the clients dream gets evaluated according to current realistic tech and what is needed to achieve the clients goals (if possible) get generally outlined.


#### Step 3: definition of top-level requirements (TLRs)
- Preformed by system team.
- The requirements from steps 1 and 2 get converted into [[top level requirements (subsystems)|top level requirements]].


#### Step 4: Generation of design requirements
- Preformed by system team.
- The [[top level requirements (subsystems)|top level requirements]] get converted into design requirements which are subsystem specific requirements (For example in reference to a power subsystem could be max waste heat, size, operating conditions (eg reference to sun), power output specifics, variation in output).
- Subsystem requirements are often long quantitative lists.
