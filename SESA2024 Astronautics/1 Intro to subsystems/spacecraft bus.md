## Spacecraft bus
Sadly this isn't what first pops into your head, instead bus essentially refers to all the bits of the spacecraft which support the [[payload subsystem|payload]].

Just like a normal bus's job is to move the important stuff around while keeping it comfortable a spacecraft bus supports the payload and moves it to the correct location and provides power, temperate regulation, structural support ect.
