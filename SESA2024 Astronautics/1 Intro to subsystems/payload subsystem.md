## Payload subsystem
We call the payload the bit that fulfils mission objectives using a variety of sensors, communications hardware ect (the bit that preforms/measures the stuff you actually want once at the right location).

If your operation is blowing up Fr\*nce, the payload is well the payload (a nuke :trol:).

The payload is supported by the [[spacecraft bus|bus]].
