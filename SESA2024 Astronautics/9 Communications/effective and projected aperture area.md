## Effective and projected aperture area
([[HOLY SHIT IS THAT A PORTAL REFRENCE|aperture science]])
### Projected aperture area ($A,\:A_{phy},\:A_{e}$)
Basically, look strait at the aperture, the 2D area of that disk when viewed from the font is $A$.

### Effective aperture area ($A_{eff}$)
Don't really need to know the specifics but it's the area that the aperture seems to actually operate at:

> ### $$ A_{eff} = A \eta $$ 
>> where:
>> $A_{eff}=$ [[effective and projected aperture area|effective aperture area]]
>> $A=$ [[effective and projected aperture area|projected aperture area]]
>> $\eta=$ aperture efficiency
