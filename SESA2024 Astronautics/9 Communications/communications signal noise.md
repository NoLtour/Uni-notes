## Communications signal noise
### Description
Noise is any unwanted interference with the signal, can be from both artificial and natural sources.

Recovering useful information from a signal despite the effect of noise while encoding the maximum amount of data is basically the main challenge of creating an effective communications system.

### Sources
As stated previously there are [[litterally all of space is giving you noise|lot]]:
- Atmospheric emission and scattering
- Sun, other stars, supernovas the [[it does though|fucking big bang]]
- Electrical machinery
- Basically all electronics

### Characterising noise ($N$)
We represent noise as a temperature $N$, yes a temperature (if you think about it in context that does actually make sense) where:

> ### $$ N = k_B  TB $$ 
>> where:
>> $N=$ [[communications signal noise|noise]]
>> $T=$ equivalent noise temperature
>> $B=$ bandwidth
>> $k_{B}=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]

#### Noise density ($N_{0}$)

This is the noise power per unit bandwidth.

> ### $$ N_{0} = k_B  T $$ 
>> where:
>> $N_{0}=$ [[communications signal noise|noise density]]
>> $T=$ equivalent noise temperature
>> $k_{B}=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
