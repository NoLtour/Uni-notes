## Isotropic and high gain antenna
### Isotropic antenna
Where the signal is transmitted/received equally in all directions:

### High gain antenna
Where the signal transmission/reception is concentrated in a specific direction:

The [[antenna gain|gain]] is greatly increased this way.

#### Calculating beamwidth

The beamwidth of a parabolic high gain antenna can be found using:
> ### $$ \theta_{3dB} = 72 \frac{\lambda}{D} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\theta_{3dB}=$ [[half power beamwidth]]
>> $\lambda=$ operating wavelength
>> $D=$ diameter of the parabolic dish
