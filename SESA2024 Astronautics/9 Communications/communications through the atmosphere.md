## Communications through the atmosphere
### Atmospheric [[huh what you thinking about|penetration]]
The [[communications subsystem]] generally uses microwaves to send and recieve data, this frequency it quite effective at penetrating the atmosphere (relative to others). There are however still substantial absorbtion which limits communication:

Communication systems tend to have highly variable atmospheric windows, cloud cover and rain have strong effects on communication effectiveness:

### Frequency bands
Annoyingly there is only so much electromagnetic spectrum, and a very limited band that's useful for atmospheric penetrating communication. This has lead to tight international regulation on who can use what frequency bands:
