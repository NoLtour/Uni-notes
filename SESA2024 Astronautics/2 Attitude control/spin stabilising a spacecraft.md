## Spin stabilising a spacecraft
### Outline
This is exactly what it sounds like, you spin the craft somewhere in the range of 10 to 60 rpm which leads to stability due to [[gyroscopic rigidity]], [[gyroscopic procession]] and the fact that external influences such as drag tend to act on the body such that there is less net torque.

### Consequences
Well now anything axially positioned is rotating such that not only are there constant G forces applied but also there is equal time spent in all directions along the axis of rotation. This can be useful in some senses but also detrimental:
- Minimal thermal gradients across the craft due to equal radiation exposure
- Radiative cooling and solar arrays cannot operate at high efficiency's meaning more weight to reach same effectiveness compared to constant optimal orientation
- Most payloads/communication equipment cannot function effectively if radially mounted.

### Choice of spin axis
The spin axis can only have a constant direction if it is a [[principle axis]] (specifically either one with the maximum or minimum [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]] else you get [[spin vid|this issue]]).
For long term stability it's best to choose the axis of maximum inertia.
