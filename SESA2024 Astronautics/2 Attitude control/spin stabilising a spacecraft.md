## Spin stabilising a spacecraft
### Outline
This is exactly what it sounds like, you spin the craft somewhere in the range of 10 to 60 rpm which leads to stability due to [[gyroscopic rigidity]], [[gyroscopic procession]] and the fact that external influences such as drag tend to act on the body such that there is less net torque.

### Consequences
Well now anything
