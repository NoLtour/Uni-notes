## Sources of instability in an [[moment of inertia|inertia matrix]]

![[moment of inertia#^cc3cb6]]

The [[products of inertia]] can be interpreted as "a measure of unbalance", they lead to [[cross-coupling]]. This makes them useful for desiging stable vehicles, by ensuring mass is properly distrobuted by properly balanceing the layout of components you can reduce the natural instability of a vehicle (this of course is easyer sad.
