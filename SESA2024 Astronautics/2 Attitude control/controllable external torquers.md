## Controllable external torquers

### Gas jets 
- Thrust goes brr, thing goes zrrr ([[I think I explained that quite well|essentially]]).
- Generally only has binary ON/OFF control.
- Requires propellant and since you need quite a few all over the place quite complex plumbing.
- Fast response.

### Magnetorquers
- Creates a magnetic field to interact with external magnetic fields for creating torque. Hence effectiveness heavily depends on environment.
- Requires detailed understanding of external magnetic field as well as on board interactions.
- Only uses power.
- Can not create torque about the external field line.
- Slow response.

### Geometry manipulation
- Can utilize [[disturbance torques|radiation pressure]] or [[disturbance torques|aerodynamic distrubance]] to create torques.
- Slow response.
- Effectiveness varies based on position relative to radiation sources (mainly the sun), or atmosphere.
- Only uses power, but also has mechanical dependence.
