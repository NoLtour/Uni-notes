## Attitude sensor

### Sensor categories

### Reference sensor
These figure out the vehicles attitude by using some known reference point (eg: star, some transmission station, gps, horizon) different references have different accuracies.

The problem with reference sensors is that often there is periodic disturbance to being able to trach the reference.

### Inertial sensor
These figure out the vehicles attitude by using something to measure the relative change between some onboard thing vs the main vehicle body, such as a gyroscope. These build up errors over time leading to inaccuracy and need for recalibration.
