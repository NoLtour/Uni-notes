## Disturbance [[internal and external torques|torques]]
Refer back to this chart:

Here we're talking about really, really weak forces measured in tiny fractions of a newton; of course over days, weeks, years constant tiny forces really add up in space.

### Aerodynamic
The atmosphere of planets extends waaay higher than you think, though in this context we're talking so thin that it's basically a vacuum. The geometry of the spacecraft and especially asymmetry lead to net rotational torques, think large flat things like solar panels.

### Gravitational gradient
- Caused by the subtle difference in gravitational field strength between different locations of a spacecraft.
- Heavily dependent on [[moment of inertia|inertia matrix]].
- Can be used as an effective method for passive stabilisation, think long satellite.

### Radiation pressure
- The force imparted by photons and other forms of radiation hitting your spacecraft.
- Depends on geometry (again think solar panels as sails).
- Can be used for attitude control (but very slow) and of course stabilisation.

### Magnetic
- The interaction between localised and planetary magnetic fields
- Can be used for attitude control (but very slow) and of course stabilisation.

### Thrust misalignment
- The effect of over/underburing a thruster and or misalignment
- Over planatery scales even 1mm misalignment becomes HUGE so it's basically inevitable
