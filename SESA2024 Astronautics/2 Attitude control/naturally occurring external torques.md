## Naturally occurring [[internal and external torques|external torques]]
Refer back to this chart:

Here we're talking about really, really weak forces measured in tiny fractions of a newton; of course over days, weeks, years constant tiny forces really add up in space.

### Aerodynamic
The atmosphere of planets extends waaay higher than you think, though in this context we're talking so thin that it's basically a vacuum. 
- Geometry of spacecraft and especially asymmetry lead to net rotational torques
