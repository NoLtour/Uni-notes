## Goals of attitude control
### Things in space don't change
Basically, if you slab some metal in space with no spin, it'll continue to not spin:

(at least barring it being huge and given a few million years to tidally lock)

### What we want
Basically what we want the spacecraft to do while in orbit during the duration of the mission varies based on payload/mission goals/[[essential spacecraft subsystems|subsystems]]:
- Solar panels work best faceing the sun
- Coms need to face specific directions
- Radiators work best not facing the sun
- Telescopes need to go all over the place
- Pointy bit should [[rocket go brrrrrrrrr|point in right direction]]
- Atmosphere causes unequal drag in many cases which builds up even in really thin conditions

Essentially: Where the thing points is important, we need to control it + we need to prevent annoying things fucking with the rotation.
