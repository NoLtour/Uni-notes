## Internal and external torques
#### External torques
This is quite self explanatory, external torques are interactions between the vehicle and the surroundings and result in changes. (eg radiation pressure, cold gas thrusters)

#### External torques
Internal torques are interactions between the components of the satellite, for example the rotation of the solar panels, which results in no net change of [[moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] but a change between components. (eg reaction control wheels)
