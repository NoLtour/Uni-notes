## 3 axis spacecraft stabilisation
### Outline
Unlike the others this does not primarily use rotation to increase [[gyroscopic rigidity|rotational rigidity]], instead it makes use of torque producing devices that  apply internal and external torques. Without the presence of large quantities of [[moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] the body has much more freedom to change orientation.

### Consequences
- Generally requires more complex systems to accommodate stabilisation
- Greater flexibility in layout of mass
- Much more freedom for reorientation, hence is very useful for things such as telescopes (since all 3 axis of rotation can be controlled).
