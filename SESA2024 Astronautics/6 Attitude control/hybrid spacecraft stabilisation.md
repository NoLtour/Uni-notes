## Hybrid spacecraft stabilisation

### Outline
Similar to just [[spin stabilising a spacecraft]] except instead of spinning the whole thing you slap a rotating bit inside the spacecraft. The big difference here with the other two is that here it's a relatively low mass disk which spins at high speeds to achieve the same [[moment of inertia|rotational inertia]].

Some configurations my have multiple wheels.

### Consequences
- Space and mass are somewhat wasted on the wheel, since with the other configurations the mass used for stabilisation has other purposes.
- Since overall the main structures not spinning it allows for more freedom with configuration.
- Can more easily  vary the rotation speed to enable greater control over craft orientation.


### Dampening
To counteract [[nutation]] you might have passive or active dampeners to counteract the nutation.
