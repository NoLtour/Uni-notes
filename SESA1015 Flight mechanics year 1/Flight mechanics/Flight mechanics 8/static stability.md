#### What is
## Static stability
### Intro
First if we look at the definition of stability: "Stability is defined as the ability of an aircraft to return to a given equilibrium state after a disturbance." (this might be caused by a gust or a small movement of the control surfaces)

Then static stability is when: "when an aircraft is disturbed from it's equalibrium position by a small amount, the forces/moments caused by the change in position tend towords returning the aircraft to it's equalibrium"

For example [[longitudional static stability and trim|logitudional static stability]] would be the aircraft gaining a upwards pitch when pitching down and a downwards pitch when pitching up; hence it would automatically remain in it's equalibrium state.
