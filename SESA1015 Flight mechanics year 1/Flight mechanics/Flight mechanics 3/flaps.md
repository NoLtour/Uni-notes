#### What is the function of
## Flaps
### Description
Flaps serve to increase [[lift coefficient]] of an aircraft when deployed, they therefor also massively increase the [[induced drag coefficient]], they are very useful for the slow speeds of takeoff and landing. It should be noted that when deployed they have this effect because they:
- Effectively increase the size of the wing
- Direct air downwards, similar to aerofoil camber
