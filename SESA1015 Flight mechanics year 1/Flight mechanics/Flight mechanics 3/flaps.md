#### What is the function of
## Flaps
### Description
Flaps serve to increase [[lift coefficient]] of an aircraft when deployed, they therefor also massively increase the [[induced drag coefficient]], they are very useful for the slow speeds of takeoff and landing. It should be noted that when deployed they have this effect because they:
- Effectively increase the size of the wing
- Direct air downwards, similar to aerofoil camber

### Flap CFD

Here you can see the flow around a flap behind the main wing, it can be seen that the gap in between the wings allows air to flow which increases the velocity along the top back, this delays [[boundary layer separation]] and hence stall. Of course some flaps don't have this [[hey why are you expecting something inappropriate|lil hole]], but in doing so are more likely to end up stalling the wing when trying to deploy.


### Flap types

Just looking at these you can probably get an intuitive feel for the benefits/drawbacks of each design:
- Complexity vs simplicity
- Weight of mechanism
- Efficiency trade offs
- Higher/lower max CL increase
- Parasitic drag when not in use

### Flap effect on CL curve

Flaps influence $C_{L}$ by increasing the effective camber of the wing and increasing the wing area. The effect of adding effective camber changes the zero lift angle $\alpha_{L=0}$. The more the flaps deploy, the more negative $\alpha_{L=0}$ becomes. Stall angle may drop due to flow separation on the flap.
