#### What is the function of
## Flaps
### Description
Flaps serve to increase [[lift coefficient]] of an aircraft when deployed, they therefor also massively increase the [[induced drag coefficient]], they are very useful for the slow speeds of takeoff and landing. It should be noted that when deployed they have this effect because they:
- Effectively increase the size of the wing
- Direct air downwards, similar to aerofoil camber

Here you can see the flow around a flap behind the main wing, it can be seen that the gap in between the wings allows air to flow which increases the velocity along the top back, this delays [[boundary layer separation]] and hence stall. Of course some flaps don't have this [[hey why are you expecting something inappropriate|lil hole]], but in doing so are more likely to end up stalling the wing when trying to deploy.
