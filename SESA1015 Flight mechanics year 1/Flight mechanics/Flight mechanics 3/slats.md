#### What is the function of
## Slats
### Description
These sit at the leading edge of an aircraft wings and increase the maximum [[angle of attack]] an aircraft can reach when deployed, allowing for a higher maximum [[lift coefficient]], they do however increase drag when deployed.

### Effect on CL curve

Since [[miner spelling mistake|sluts]] do effectively increase the foils camber they do slightly increase $C_{L}$ but the primary effect is decreasing flow separation allowing for a greater max $C_{L}$.
