#### What's an aircraft's
## Wing aspect ratio
Aspect ratio ($A$), this is the ratio of a planes [[Wing span]] to its [[Mean chord]].

> $$ A = \frac{b}{\bar{c}} $$
> $$ A = \frac{b^{2}}{S} $$ 
>> where:
>> $A =$ Aspect ratio
>> $b =$ [[Wing span]]
>> $\bar{c} =$ [[Mean chord]]
>> $S =$ [[Wing plan area]]
