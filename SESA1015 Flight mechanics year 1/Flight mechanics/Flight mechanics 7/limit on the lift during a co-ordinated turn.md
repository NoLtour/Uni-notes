#### What is the
## Limit on the lift during a co-ordinated turn

> ### $$R_{min} = \frac{V^{2}}{g} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \left(\frac{L_{max}}{W}\right)^{2} - 1}}$$

> ### $$ R_{min} = \frac{V^{2}}{g} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ \left( \frac{V}{V_S} \right)^{4} - 1}} $$

It should be noted that if the speed equals the [[stalling speed]] (for steady level flight) then $R_{min}=\infty$ meaning that if the aircraft is flying at its [[stalling speed]] it cannot preform a co-ordinated turn without falling out of the sky.
