#### What is
## Enthalpy $E_{h}$
Enthalpy is a property of a thermodynamic [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], is the sum of the system's [[internal energy]] and the product of its pressure and volume.

>> $P=$ Pressure
>> $V=$ Volume
>> $E_u=$ [[internal energy]]

Since [[enthalpy]] cannot be directly
