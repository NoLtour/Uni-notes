#### What is
## Enthalpy $E_{h}$
Enthalpy is a property of a thermodynamic [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], is the equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.

>> $V=$ Volume
>> $E_u=$ [[internal energy]]

Something

Since [[enthalpy]] cannot be directly measured we alwayse use relative enthalpys by describing [[enthalpy]] change of a system between states.
