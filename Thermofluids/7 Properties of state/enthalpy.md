#### What is
## Enthalpy $E_{h}$
Enthalpy is a property of a thermodynamic [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], is the equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.

> ### $$ E_{h} = PV + E_u $$ 
> ### $$ \Delta E_{h} = \Delta PV + \Delta E_u $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_{h}=$ [[enthalpy]]
>> $P=$ Pressure
>> $V=$ Volume
>> $E_u=$ [[internal energy]]

Something else that is important is that change in enthalpy equals the change in heat:
> ### $$ \Delta E_h = \Delta Q $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_h=$ [[enthalpy]] 
>> $Q=$ [[heat]]
>> $E_h \neq Q$

Since [[enthalpy]] cannot be directly measured we alwayse use relative enthalpys by describing [[enthalpy]] change of a system between states.
