#### What is
## Enthalpy $E_{h}$
Enthalpy is a property of a thermodynamic [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], is the equal to the system's [[internal energy]] plus the product of its pressure and volume.
But the enthalpy of an [[ideal gas law|ideal gas]] is independent of its pressure or volume, and depends only on its temperature, which correlates to its thermal energy. Real gases at common temperatures and pressures often closely approximate this behavior, which simplifies practical thermodynamic design and analysis. 

> ### $$ \begin{align*}\Delta E_{h} &= \Delta PV + \Delta  E_u \\ &= \Delta W + \Delta E_u\end{align*} $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_{h}=$ [[enthalpy]]
>> $W=$ [[pressure volume work]]
>> $E_u=$ [[internal energy]]

For an ideal gas the following can be used:

> ### $$ d E_{h} = C_{p} dT $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_{h}=$ [[enthalpy]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
>> $C_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]]

Something else that is important is that change in enthalpy equals the change in heat:
> ### $$ d E_{h} = T \cdot dS + V \cdot dp $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_h=$ [[enthalpy]] 
>> $S=$ [[entropy]]
>> $V=$ volume
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $T=$ abs temp

Since [[enthalpy]] cannot be directly measured we alwayse use relative enthalpys by describing [[enthalpy]] change of a system between states.
