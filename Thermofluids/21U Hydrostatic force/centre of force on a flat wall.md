#### How can you calculate
## Centre of force on a flat wall
### Equation
General form, this would work for walls with variable thickness and variable pressures:

> ### $$ 0 = \int^{H}_{0} h p(h) \times w(h) - h_{c} p(h) \times w(h) \cdot dh $$ 
>> where:
>> $H=$ vertical height of the wall where the force acts over
>> $h=$ vertical hieght postion (remember you may need to adjust formula when working with angled surfaces)
>> $h_c=$ h position of centre of force
>> $p(h)=$ pressure as a function of verticle hieght
>> $w(h)=$ pressure as a function of verticle height

Simplified form that takes in [[pressure (hydrostatics)^]]

### Proof
