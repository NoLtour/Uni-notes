#### How can you find
## Net moments the wall of a fluid container
This is really simple, first you find the centre of force from the reaction of the wall and then you find the centre of force from the pressure force. This then you find the distance between them and multiply that by the magnitude of one of the forces (doesn't matter since both are equal, well hopefully becaUSE IF THEY ARN'T EQUAL FORCES)
