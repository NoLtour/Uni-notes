#### How can you find
## Net moments the wall of a fluid container
This is really simple, first you find the centre of force from the reaction of the wall and then you find the centre of force from the pressure force. This then you find the distance between them and multiply that by the magnitude of one of the forces (doesn't matter since both are equal, well hopefully becauase if they arn't equal forces then you will have a catastrophic failure):

>> where:
>> $F=$ Force acting on one side of the wall 
>> $h_{p}=$ Vertical position of centre of pressure force
>> $h_{r}=$ Vertical position of centre of pressure force
>> $M=$ Moments acting on the wall

It is common for $h_{r}$ to
