#### What methods are there for
## Increasing efficiency of an [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]]
### Increasing [[volume compression ratio (engines)|compression ratio]]
If we are keeping it over the same temperature range then the main method is to increase the [[volume compression ratio (engines)|compression ratio]], this "stretches" the graph resaulting in a greater area of the shape and hence a greater work to be extracted:

There are some limitations of this of course:
- There are diminishing returns on increasing the [[volume compression ratio (engines)|compression ratio]]
- If the fuel gets compressed too much it can spontaniously combust which causes a [[as alwayse this is the technical term|shitshow]]

You can reduce the fuels tendency to spontaniously combust by adding addatives like lead (hence why we did that) but the mouth breathing masses complained about stupid little things like "air polution", "perminant brain damage" and "cancer". So we stopped doing that and now use less fun chemicals, smh. Next people are going to tell me to stop [[eating my cigerette]]s or stop clubbing baby seals, this is litterally 1984.
