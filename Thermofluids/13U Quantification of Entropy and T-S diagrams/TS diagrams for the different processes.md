#### What are the
## [[TS diagram]]s for the different processes

### [[isochoric heat transfer|Isochoric]] heat transfer
On the graph the line labelled $C_v$ is the [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process, as you can see there is an increase in entropy but not as much as the [[isobaric expansion or compression|isobaric]] process.

### [[isobaric expansion or compression|Isobaric]] heat transfer
This is the one labelled $C_p$ if we compare [[the two entropy equations]] we can explain the difference in graph shape:
