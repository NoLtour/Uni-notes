#### How can you derive the
## Venturi meter equation

![[Pasted image 20220214221351.png]]

Basically slap a bit of [[Bernouillis equation]], some [[conservation of mass in flow]] and a bit of [[pressure (hydrostatics)]] and...

$$\begin{align*}
P_{Atm} &= \rho g h_{1} & P_{Atm} &= \rho g h_{2} 
\end{align*}$$

This thing is based, because if you know the cross sectional area of the pipe it allows you to find the speed of the fluid without anything complex... simplicity is very useful!
