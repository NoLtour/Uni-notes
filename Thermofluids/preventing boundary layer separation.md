#### What are methods for
## Preventing [[boundary layer separation]]
### Intro
Generally there is a trade off between optimising to reduce [[skin drag|skin friction]] and [[form drag]], of course it is still possible to reach a minimum in overall drag but keep in mind decreasing one form of drag often increases the other.

### Dimples

Although usually thought of as something exclusively on golf balls it is used in a wide range of applications. Dimpling creates turbulant flow over the magority of the surface but in doing so pushes more fluid to the back of the ball making boundary layer separation occur later and hence reducing [[form drag]] at the expense of increasing [[skin drag]].
