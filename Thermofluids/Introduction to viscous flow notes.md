# Introduction to viscous flow notes

#### Intro and contents
This seems to be kinda just intro stuff, not really much deserving of proper files.

Imagine holding a solid substance between the palms of your hands. When you move your right hand away from you and your left hand towards you, the forces from your hand are transmitted through the substance. This is because the molecules in defined positions. When displaced slightly, the inter-molecular bonds resist in a spring-like manner. In static equilibrium, each layer experiences the same shear stress.

Now imagine that the solid substance is replaced with some “thick” fluid like honey. When you move your hands, the honey flows into a new shape. This is because the molecules do not have defined positions and cannot support a shear stress when in static equilibrium. When one layer is displaced, they flow over each other to accommodate the displacement. There is a shear stress, however, in the moments before mechanical equilibrium is reached. We will soon see that it is proportional to the rate of strain, dvx=d y.

What would happen if we replaced the honey with the inviscid fluid that we have considered so far? An inviscid fluid has perfect slip. It cannot support any shear stress at all. It would be the perfect lubricant (if you could keep it in the desired place).

Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow. It describes the internal friction of a moving fluid. A fluid with large viscosity resists motion because its molecular makeup gives it a lot of internal friction. A fluid with low viscosity flows easily because its molecular makeup results in very little friction when it is in motion.
