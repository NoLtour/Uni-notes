#### What is a
## TS diagram
These are diagrams that show changes to temperature and [[entropy]] during a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]]. Normally you will draw a TS diagram in parralel with a [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]] so you can compare the two.

Here you can see how each of the [[types of process]] have different TS diagrams, we elaborate on this in [[TS diagrams for the different processes]].

Since change in [[entropy]] is defined as:
![[entropy#Equation]]
If there is no change in [[heat]] there is no change in [[entropy]].
