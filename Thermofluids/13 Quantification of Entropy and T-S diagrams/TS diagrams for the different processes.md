#### What are the
## [[TS diagram]]s for the different processes
![[Pasted image 20211212130827.png]]

### [[isochoric heat transfer|Isochoric]] heat transfer
On the graph the line labelled $C_v$ is the [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process, as you can see there is an increase in entropy but not as much as the [[isobaric expansion or compression|isobaric]] process.

### [[isobaric expansion or compression|Isobaric]] heat transfer
This is the one labelled $C_p$ if we compare [[the two entropy equations]] we can explain the difference in graph shape:
![[the two entropy equations#^40621f]]
![[the two entropy equations#^a33899]]
The top one is for a [[isobaric expansion or compression|isobaric]] process and the bottom one is for a [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process, that lil minus bit on the end shows that the [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process for the same temp change produces a smaller increase in [[entropy]].

### [[isothermal expansion or compression|Isothermal]] heat transfer
[[isothermal expansion or compression|Isothermal]] occurs at constant temperature, so refering back to the equation for [[entropy]]:
![[entropy#^8db5aa]]
It is litterally just this, so highly ez. It is just the horizontal line.

### [[adiabatic expansion or compression|Adiabetic]] heat transfer
Assuming that it is frictionless this is a [[isentropic process]] so $\Delta S=0$ hence it is the line going strait up.
