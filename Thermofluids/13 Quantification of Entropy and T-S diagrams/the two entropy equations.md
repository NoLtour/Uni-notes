#### What are and how do you get
## The two [[entropy]] equations

### Derivation
#### [[isobaric expansion or compression|Isobaric]] heating

So we know that we transfer a small amount of energy ($dQ$) and allow the volume to change ($dV$) which maintains a constant pressure:
$$\begin{align*}
dQ &= C_P \cdot dT = C_V \cdot dT + P \cdot dV
\end{align*}$$
(taken from [[isobaric expansion or compression#heat Heat transfer]])
