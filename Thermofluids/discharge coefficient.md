#### What is the
## Discharge coefficient
This is a coefficient that represents the ratio between the actual and theoretical mass flow rate (according to [[Bernouillis equation]]), it can be used to represent frictional losses in pipes:

> ### $$ C_{d} = \frac{Q_{e}}{Q_{t}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{d}=$ [[discharge coefficient]] 
>> $Q_{e}=$ experimental mass flow rate
>> $Q_{t}=$ theoretical mass flow rate (no friction)

To apply it in a venturi nozzle:
