#### What is the
## Discharge coefficient
This is a coefficient that represents the ratio between the actual and theoretical mass flow rate (according to [[Bernouillis equation]]), it can be used to represent frictional losses in pipes:

> ### $$ C_{d} = \frac{Q_{e}}{Q_{t}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{d}=$ [[discharge coefficient]] 
>> $Q_{e}=$ experimental mass flow rate
>> $Q_{t}=$ theoretical mass flow rate (no friction)

To apply it in a venturi nozzle:

> ### $$ Q_{e} = \sqrt{ 2 \frac{ g(h_{1} - h_{2}) + \frac{1}{\rho} ( P_{1} - P_{2} ) }{ \left(\frac{1}{A_{2}^{2}} - \frac{1}{A_{1}^{2}}\right) } } $$
