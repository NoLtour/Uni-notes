#### What are
## Reversible and irreversible processes
### Reversible process
#### Definition
A reversible [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] that can reverse it's tragectory along a [[path (thermodynamics)|path]].

#### Characteristics
- zero friction
- [[heat]] transfer resaults in no temperature difference

#### Subcatagorys
Not all reversibled procces are the same, there are:
- [[internally reversible processes]]
- [[externally reversible processes]]
- [[fully reversible processes]]
