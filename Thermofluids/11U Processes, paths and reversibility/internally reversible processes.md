#### What are
## Internally [[reversible and irreversible processes|reversible process]]
This is a [[reversible and irreversible processes|reversible process]] where:
  - No irreversibilities exist within the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]].
  -  The [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] moves slowly and without friction through a series of [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] [[state (thermodynamics)|states]].
  -  Irreversibilities may exist in the surroundings, usually due to [[heat]] transfer through a finite temperature difference.
