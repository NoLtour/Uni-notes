#### What are
## Externally reversible processes
These are [[reversible and irreversible processes|reversible processes]] where:
-  No irreversibilities exist within the system.
-    The system moves slowly and without friction through a series of equilibrium states.
-    Irreversibilities may exist in the surroundings, usually due to heat transfer through a finite temperature difference.
