#### What is a
## Cycle (thermodynamics)
### Desc
#### Definition
A thermodynamic cycle consists of a linked sequence of thermodynamic [[process (thermodynamics)|processes]] that involve transfer of [[heat]] and work into and out of the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], while varying pressure, temperature, and other state variables within the system, and that eventually returns the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] to its initial state.

We usually represent cycles on [[p-v diagrams]]:

#### Consequences and use
- Due to [[the 2 property rule|the two property rule]] a [[path (thermodynamics)|path]] on a [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]] can fully describe the [[process (thermodynamics)|process]].
- To specifiy a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] we need to know the initial and final [[state (thermodynamics)|states]] and the transfers across the [[system boundary]] must be defined.
- Unless we make futher assumptions we cannot calculate the [[state (thermodynamics)|state]] in between the initial and final state.
