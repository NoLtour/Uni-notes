#### What is a
## Cycle (thermodynamics)
### Introduction
A thermodynamic cycle consists of a linked sequence of thermodynamic [[process (thermodynamics)|processes]] that involve transfer of [[heat]] and work into and out of the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]], while varying pressure, temperature, and other state variables within the system, and that eventually returns the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] to its initial state.

We usually represent cycles on [[p-v diagrams]]:
