#### What is
## Isochoric heat transfer
### Definition
This is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] in a [[closed system]] where there is no change in volume, as represented on this [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]]:

According to $P(\Delta V)=W$ since there is no change in volume in an [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process there is no [[pressure volume work]] done.

### Consequential relationships
##### Conservation of energy:

##### Work transfer
Total work = None + (zero) + nothing + [[wait shit by reading this it applied to me|your IQ]] + emptyness = 0
(there is none is what I'm getting at here)
##### [[heat|Heat]] transfer
> ### $$ Q_{12} = E_{u12} = mC_v (T_2-T_1) $$ 
>> where:
>> $Q_{12}=$ [[heat]] transfer from starting to ending conditions
>> $E_{u12}=$ [[internal energy]] change from starting to ending conditions
>> $T_1=$ initial temperature
>> $T_2=$ final temperature
>> $m=$ mass 
>> $C_v=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
