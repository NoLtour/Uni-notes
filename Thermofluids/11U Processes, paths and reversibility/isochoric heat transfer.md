#### What is
## Isochoric heat transfer
### Definition
This is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] in a [[closed system]] where there is no change in volume, as represented on this [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]]:

According to $P(\Delta V)=W$ since there is no change in volume in an [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]] process there is no [[pressure volume work]] done.
