#### What is
## Isobaric expansion or compression
### Definition
This is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] in a [[closed system]] where there is no change in pressure, as represented on this [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]]:

According to $P(\Delta V)=W$ since there can be a change in volume in an [[isobaric expansion or compression|isobaric]] process there can be [[pressure volume work]] done.

### Consequential relationships
These are useful when doing calculations on [[p-v diagrams]] since they can be used to calculate the changes in the properties between [[state (thermodynamics)|states]] where the [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] is [[isochoric heat transfer|isochoric]].

##### Conservation of energy:
> ### $$ Q_{12} - W_{12} = E_{u12} $$ 
> ### $$ Q_{12} = E_{u12} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Q_{12}=$ [[heat]] transfer from starting to ending conditions
>> $E_{u12}=$ [[internal energy]] change from starting to ending conditions
>> $W_{12}=$ work done from starting to ending conditions

##### Work transfer
Total work = None + (zero) + nothing + [[wait shit by reading this it applied to me|your IQ]] + emptyness = 0
(there is none, that is what I'm getting at here)

##### [[heat|Heat]] transfer
> ### $$ Q_{12} = E_{u12} = mC_v (T_2-T_1) $$ 
>> where:
>> $Q_{12}=$ [[heat]] transfer from starting to ending conditions
>> $E_{u12}=$ [[internal energy]] change from starting to ending conditions
>> $T_1=$ initial temperature
>> $T_2=$ final temperature
>> $m=$ mass 
>> $C_v=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]

### Example
Adding heat to a sealed ridgid container. (this is basically what you will use this for, [[yes I will use kek unironically|kek]])
