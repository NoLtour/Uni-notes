#### What is the
## Boundary layer
### Introduction
This is a layer of fluid near the rough surface that the fluid is interacting with in which the velocity of the fluid changes between the [[freestream]] velocity and the velocity adjacent to the surface (which would be zero due to the [[fluid no slip condition]]):

In the images above the boundary layer is everything below the limit of boundary layer.

### Types of boundary layer
One of the most important descriptors of a boundary layer is at what points it's laminar or turbulent. Boundary layers generally start out in laminar flow and transition into turbulent flow as seen in the diagrams above.

#### Laminar boundary layer flow
This is when the boundary layer has a [[laminar flow regime]], in laminar flow there is less skin friction drag than in turbulent flow but it is less stable which is why it often transitions into turbulent flow. Boundary layers always start in laminar flow.

#### Turbulent boundary layer flow
This is when the boundary layer has a [[turbulent flow regime]]. Turbulent boundary layer sections are always located downstream of laminar boundary layers (since boundary layers start out laminar).
