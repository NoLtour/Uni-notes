#### What is
## Absolute roughness (pipe) ($\varepsilon$)
Absolute pipe roughness is a measure of pipe wall irregularities of commercial pipes, measured in unit lengths (such as mm or m). 

(I haven't been able to find a concrete definition for how this is measured, I think it's just a coefficient not perfectly linked to the actual hieght of bumps on the material but some combination of: height variation, bumb shape, bump frequency and possibly more. Used to lump all these into a convenient number because people are [[I mean based|lazy]])
