#### Describe the
## Effect of viscosity on flow
At high [[viscosity]]s turbulant flow becomes impared and makes it so [[eddy (fluids)|eddies]] can't form. So high viscosity fluids tend to also have low [[Reynolds number]]s ([[litreeaoijifaw|litterally]] in [[Reynolds number#^cb3204|the equation]]).
