Finding the [[darcy-weisbach friction factor]] for a [[relative roughness]] and [[reynolds number]] is easy for laminar flow:

![[darcy-weisbach friction factor#^753b11]]

But for turbulent flow it is a massive pain in the ass (because [[smh how hard can it be lmao|modelling turbulent flow isn't easy]]) so we use the [[moody diagram]] instead.
