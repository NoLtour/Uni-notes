#### Describe
## Boundary layer momentum thickness ($\theta$)
The momentum thickness, Î¸  is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved perpendicular from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity $U_{0}$ to give the same total momentum as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.

The defenition is confusing, but essent

> ### $$ \theta = \int^{\infty}_{0} \frac{U(y)}{U_{\infty}}\left( 1 - \frac{U(y)}{U_{\infty}} \right) dy= \int^{\infty}_{0} \frac{ U}{U_{\infty}}\left( 1 - \frac{U }{U_{\infty}} \right) dy $$ 
>> where:
>> $\theta=$ [[boundary layer momentum thickness]]
>> $U(y)=$ flow rate as a function of y
>> $y=$ displacement relative to surface
>> $U_{\infty}=$ [[freestream]] veloicty
>> Flow is incompressible
