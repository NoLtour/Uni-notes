#### Describe
## Boundary layer momentum thickness ($\theta$)
The momentum thickness, Î¸  is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved perpendicular from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity $U_{0}$ to give the same total momentum as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.


> ### $$ \theta = \int^{\infty}_{0} \left( 1 - \frac{U(y)}{U_{0}} \right) dy $$ 
>> where:
>> $\theta=$ [[boundary layer momentum thickness]]
>> $U(y)=$ flow rate as a function of y
>> $y=$ displacement relative to surface
>> $U_{0}=$ Free stream velocity?? [[UNFINISHED STUFF|notes don't clarify so check, they also use 0 not inf so idk]]
>> Flow is incompressible
