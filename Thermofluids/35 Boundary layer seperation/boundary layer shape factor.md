#### What is
## Boundary layer shape factor ($H$)
A shape factor is a value that describes the nature of flow:

> ### $$ H = \frac{\delta *}{\theta} $$ 
>> where:
>> $H=$ [[boundary layer shape factor]]
>> $\delta *=$ [[boundary layer displacement thickness]]
>> $\theta=$ [[boundary layer momentum thickness]]

The greater the value of H, the stronger the adverse pressure gradient. A high adverse pressure gradient can greatly reduce the [[reynolds number]] at which transition into turbulence may occur. Hence this also increases risk of [[boundary layer separation]], so you want a small value of $H$ for most applications.

When you consider the physical meaning behined the shape factor. [[boundary layer displacement thickness|displacement thickness]] is a measure of lost volumetric flow and [[boundary layer momentum thickness|momentum thickness]] is a measure of lost momentum in flow, so consider:
$$ \frac{\theta}{\delta*} $$
This could be considered as the lost momentum per lost volumetric flow which when considering a flow profile:
