#### What is
## Boundary layer shape factor ($H$)
A shape factor is a value that describes the nature of flow:

> ### $$ H = \frac{\delta *}{\theta} $$ 
>> where:
>> $H=$ [[boundary layer shape factor]]
>> $\delta *=$ [[boundary layer displacement thickness]]
>> $\theta=$ [[boundary layer momentum thickness]]

The greater the value of H, the stronger the adverse pressure gradient. A high adverse pressure gradient can greatly reduce the [[reynolds number]] at which transition into turbulence may occur. Hence this also increases risk of [[boundary layer separation]], so you want a small value of $H$ for most applications.
