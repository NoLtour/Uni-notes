#### What are some
## Examples of entropy generation
A good engineer wants to minimise [[entropy]].

### Examples
- viscous friction (Shear Stresses) in fluid flow - leads to pressure drops in pipes, drag on objects.
- Turbulent flow - much larger pressure drops in pipes, drag on objects.
- [[heat|Heat]] transfer across a temperature difference.
- Unrestrained expansion.
- Shock waves in compressible fluids (not covered yet).
- Mixing of different fluids (not covered yet).
- Phase change (not covered yet).
