#### What is
## Entropy ($S$)
### Definition
Entropy is:
- The disorder of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]]
- A measure of how much unusable energy there is in a system

Total entropy always increases (according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]])

### Equation
> ### $$ \Delta S = \frac{\Delta Q}{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $S=$ [[entropy]]
>> $Q=$ [[heat]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
