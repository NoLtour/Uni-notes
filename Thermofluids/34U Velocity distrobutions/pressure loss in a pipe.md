#### What is
## Pressure loss in a pipe
### Equation



### Derivation
Basically take the [[pressure loss darcy weisbach equation]] and sub in the equation for [[darcy-weisbach friction factor]] with [[reynolds number]] equation.

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta p &= f_{D} \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho U^{2}}{2} & f_{D} &= \frac{64}{Re} & Re &= \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} \\
&&  f_{D} &= \frac{64\mu}{\rho U L}\\
&= \frac{64\mu}{\rho U L} \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho U^{2}}{2}\\
&= \frac{32\mu}{\rho} \frac{1}{D} \frac{\rho U}{1}
\end{align*}$$
