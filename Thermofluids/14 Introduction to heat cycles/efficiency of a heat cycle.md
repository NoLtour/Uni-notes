#### How can we find the
## Efficiency of a heat cycle ($\eta$)
### Diagram representation
We often represent the heat engine with a simple diagram that shows the heat in, heat out, the two thermal reserviours and the work out:

Here we will assume that $T_h$ and $T_c$ are very large thermal reseviours so that their temperatures remain constant.

### [[insert a lil bit of shitpost|The equation]]
This bits quite ez, from [[heat cycles in a PV diagram#Useful notes for future working]] we know that $\Sigma Q = \Sigma W$ we can get a nice equation:
> ### $$ \eta = 1 - \frac{Q_c}{Q_h} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Q_h=$ [[heat]] in
>> $Q_c=$ [[heat]] out
>> $\eta=$ Efficiency of cycle

For a reversible engine efficiency is defined purely by the temp of the hot and cold reseviour:
> ### $$ \eta = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h} $$ 
>> where:
>> $T_h=$ Temp of hot reseviour
>> $T_c=$ Temp of cold reseviour
>> $\eta=$ Efficiency of cycle

So you can see that for a reversible engine you want to maxamise the value of $T_h$ and minimise the value of $T_c$
