## First look at a real engine
There are a few steps that are done in order and repeated as cycles:
1) Compression stroke : from BDC to TDC (note clearance volume), both valves closed
2) Power/expansion stroke : Ignition of compressed mixture (near constant volume process with pressure/temperature rise), expansion of combustion mixture
3) Exhaust Stroke : Exhaust valve opens, hot gases pushed out of cylinder by stroke (> ~atm)
4) Intake Stroke : exhaust valve closes, intake open, fresh cooler air charge sucked into cylinder (< ~atm), Injection of liquid fuel usually through intake port. Exhaust/Intake strokes consume negligible power
