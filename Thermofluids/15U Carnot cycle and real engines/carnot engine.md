#### What is the
## Carnot engine
### How it works
![[Pasted image 20220104134434.png]]

It consists of:
1)  ($1 \to 2$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal compression]], work is done on the gas causing heat to flow out of the gas to the low temp reserviour.
2) ($2 \to 3$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic compression]], work is done on the gas compressing it and increasing it's temp.
3) ($3 \to 4$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal expansion]], heat is transferred to the gas expanding it and the gas preforms work.
4) ($1 \to 2$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic]] expansion, the gas continues to expand preforming work without any heat transfer.

#### Properties
- Fully reversible
- Consists of 4 processes
- It is a frictionless piston cylinder arrangement with perfectly insulated walls
- It is a theoreticall engine based on what would be theoretically most efficient, hence not really possible
