### How it works
![[Pasted image 20220104134434.png]]

It consists of:
1) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal compression]], work is done on the gas causing heat to flow out of the gas to the low temp reserviour
2) [[isentropic process|Isentropic compression]], the surround
3) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal expansion]]
4) [[isentropic process|Isentropic]] expansion

#### Properties
- Fully reversible
- Consists of 4 processes
- It is a frictionless piston cylinder arrangement with perfectly insulated walls
- It is a theoreticall engine based on what would be theoretically most efficient, hence not really possible
