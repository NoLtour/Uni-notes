#### What are
## Properties (thermodynamics)
These things that describe a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]]. (look this is such a basic description I struggle to come up with one)

For example some of the most basic properties of a system include: pressure, temperature, volume, internal energy, [[enthalpy]].

You need to also be aware of:
- [[extensive properties (thermodynamics)]]
- [[intensive properties (thermodynamics)]]
