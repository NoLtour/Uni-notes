#### What are the
## Basic assumptions of thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the science of heat, work and energy. It deals with the processes by which energy is converted into one form or another, and with the properties of matter that are relevant to such processes. Due to this fact we focus on macroscopic cause and effect hence:
- Thermodynamics is focused on macroscopic systems
- Typical sizes an engineer will deal with are huge relative to the microscopic
- Molecular fluctuations are small and so are averaged
- All substances are continues and pure (we ignore atomic differences)
- Microscopic phenomina (eg atomic chaotic KE) are treated according to their macroscopic effect (in this example temperature)

Of course these assumptions don't work on a molecular level, they are what we call "good enough" (that is the technical term) but when was the last time you had to make an atom sized rocket (no offence intended for those who specialize in atom sized rockets)?
