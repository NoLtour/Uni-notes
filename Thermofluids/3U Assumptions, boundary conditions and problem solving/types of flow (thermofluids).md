#### What are the
## Types of flow (thermofluids)
### Info
When describing flow in a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] we describe both its stability and uniformity.

#### Stability
- [[steady flow]]
- [[unsteady flow]]

#### Uniformity
- [[uniform flow]]
- [[non-uniform flow]]

#### Important notes
You need to consider the time period that the flow is observed over, for example the rapids in a river can be described as examples of [[steady flow]] over the course of a second or so but as [[unsteady flow]] over the course of hours.
