#### What is a
## Eulerian specification of the flow field
This is an approach for where you place your perspective in a situation involving fluid motion.
In the [[Eulerian specification of the flow field]] the perspective of the observer is taken from the system that the fuild is moving through, hence the [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] being considered looks like it's stationary while the fluid is moving.

This is the opposite of the [[Lagrangian specification of the flow field]].

This is the more common approach.
