#### How would you go about
## Relating measurements of scaled models through ratios
### Method


### Example
You have a water tank that has a capacity of 5,000,000 litres that is 60 meters tall, you want to build a scale model that has a capacity of 2 litres, how tall is the model and what is the length scale ratio?

> Units of litres is $m^3$ and units of height is $m$ so the scale ratio ($m$):
> $$ \begin{align*}
 \rt{ \frac{60m^{-3}{5000000m^{3}}} } &=
\end{align*} $$
