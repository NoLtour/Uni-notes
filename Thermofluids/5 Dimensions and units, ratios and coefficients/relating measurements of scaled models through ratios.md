#### How would you go about
## Relating measurements of scaled models through ratios
### Method


### Examples
1) 
>> You have a water tank that has a capacity of 5,000,000 litres that is 60 meters tall, you want to build a scale model that has a capacity of 2 litres, how tall is the model and what is the length scale ratio?
>
> Units of litres is $m^3$ and units of height is $m$ so the scale ratio ($m$):
> $$ \begin{align*}
 \sqrt[3]{ \frac{ 60m^{-3} }{ 5000000m^{3} } } &= \frac{L_m}{L_r}\\
&= \frac{3}{250000}
\end{align*} $$
> So the ratio is $\frac{L_m}{L_r}= \frac{3}{250000}$
> $$ 60 \cdot \frac{3}{250000} = 0.00073 $$
> And the scale models height is 0.00073 meters.
