#### How would you go about
## Relating measurements of scaled models through ratios
### Method


### Examples
1) 
>> You have a water tank that has a capacity of 5,000,000 litres that is 60 meters tall, you want to build a scale model that has a capacity of 2 litres, how tall is the model and what is the length scale ratio?
>
> Units of litres is $m^3$ and units of height is $m$ so the scale ratio ($m$):
> $$ \begin{align*}
 \sqrt[3]{ \frac{ 60m^{-3} }{ 5000000m^{3} } } &= \frac{L_m}{L_r}\\
&= \frac{3}{250000}
\end{align*} $$
> So the ratio is $L_r = \frac{L_m}{L_r}= \frac{3}{250000}$
> $$ 60 \cdot \frac{3}{250000} = 0.00073 $$
> And the scale models height is 0.00073 meters.

2) 
>>  What is the work ratio ($W_r$) if the force ratio is 1:50 and the distance ratio is 4:15
> - Work $= ML^{2}T^{-2}$
> - Force $= MLT^{-2}$
> - Distance $=L$
> So:
> $$ \begin{align*}\\
 Work &=ML^{2}T^{-2} = MLT^{-2} \cdot L
 Work &= Force \cdot Distance \\
 W_r &= F_r \cdot L_r\\
 W_r &= \frac{1}{50} \cdot \frac{4}{15}\\
&= \frac{2}{375}
\end{align*} $$
> Hence the work ratio is 2:375
