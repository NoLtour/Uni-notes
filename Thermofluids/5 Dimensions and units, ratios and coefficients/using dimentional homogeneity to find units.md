#### How can you
## Use dimentional homogeneity to find units
Since [[dimentional homogeneity]] must be maintained, you can rearange any variable in an equation to be the subject of the equation and then convert everything into SI units to find the units of that variable.

(cba to give an example [[why I still can't be asked]])

#### Example
>> What are the units for power?
> Find the equation for power and equations that compose that one recursively:
> $$ \begin{align*}
P =& \frac{E}{t} 
\end{align*} $$
