#### What is
## dimentional homogeneity
This is the fact that when expressing any real world relationship, the SI base units on both sides of the equation must be the same. If this is not the case then your equation is not valid.

#### Example
>> Write the equation of $F=\dfrac{m_2v_2 - m_1v_1}{t}$ interms of SI base units
> $$ \begin{align*}
F=&\dfrac{m_2v_2 - m_1v_1}{t}\\
kgms^{-2} &= \frac{kg*ms^{-1} - kg*ms^{-1}}{s}\\
&= kgms^{-2}
\end{align*} $$
> As you can see dimentional homogeneity is maintained.
