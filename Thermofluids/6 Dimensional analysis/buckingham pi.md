#### What's the method for
## Buckingham $\pi$ dimensional analysis
### Getting p,n and k
#### Method
This is a method for dimensional analysis, the theorum states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving $n$ number of physical variables, then the origional equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of $p=n-k$ dimensionless parameters ($\pi_1,\pi_2,...\pi_p$) constructed from the origional variables:

> $$ p = n-k $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ number of dimensionless parameters ($\pi_1,\pi_2,...\pi_p$)
>> $n=$ number of physical variables (ignore dimensionless variables)
>> $k=$ the number of physical dimensions involved 

#### Example

>> What is k,n and p for analysing the relationship between the variables $g$, $l$, $m$ and $\tau$ (period)

> First lets break them down into dimensions:
> - $g=LT^{-2}$
> - $l=L$
> - $m=M$
> - $\tau=T$
> So we have 3 dimensions (length,time,mass), hence $k=3$
> We have 4 variables, hence $n=4$
> So $p = n-k$ giving us $p = 4-3 = 1$

### Finding the dimensionless parameters
#### Method

#### Example
>> In turbulent flow the head loss when a liquid flows through a smooth pipe is dependant upone the quantities below. Determine the fundamental scaling relationships that might be important.

> - Head loss turns out to be dimensionless
> - Mean velocity (V) = $LT^{-1}$
> - Diameter (D) =
