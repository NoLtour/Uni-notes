#### What's the method for
## Buckingham $\pi$ dimensional analysis
This is a method for dimensional analysis, the theorum states that if there is a physically meaningful equation involving $n$ number of physical variables, then the origional equation can be rewritten in terms of a set of $p=n-k$ dimensionless parameters ($\pi_1,\pi_2,...\pi_p$) constructed from the origional variables:

> $$ p = n-k $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ number of dimensionless parameters ($\pi_1,\pi_2,...\pi_p$)
>> $n=$ number of physical variables
>> $k=$ the number of physical dimensions involved

#### Examples

>> What is k,n and p for analysing the relationship between the variables $g$, $l$, $m$ and $\tau$ (period)
