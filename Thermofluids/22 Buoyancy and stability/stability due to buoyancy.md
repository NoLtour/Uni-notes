#### How can you find
## Stability due to buoyancy

The position of the centre of boyancy relative to the centre of mass determins whether buoyancy causes an object to be more or less stable:

If any of these are rotated the [[buoyancy force]]'s offset from the weight resaults in a rotating moment, in the stable case this resaults in the object returning to an upright position while an unstable state resaults in it flipping (unstable is litterally just stable but upside down).

To change stability due to buoyancy you need to change the centre of mass or the centre of buoyancys position, changing the magnitudes also has an effect but for an object that floats Weight = Upthrust.
