#### What is the equation and theory assosiated with
## Conservation of mass in flow
### Into 
Basically for most cases (no fancy $E=mc^{2}$ or $\frac{dm}{dt}_{system}\neq 0$) since mass cannot just disapear, mass in = mass out (mass is not created or destroyed). Using this fact we can derive useful equations for modelling flow in a system.

### Equation


### Proof
