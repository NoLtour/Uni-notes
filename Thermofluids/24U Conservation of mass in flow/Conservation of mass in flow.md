#### What is the equation and theory assosiated with
## Conservation of mass in flow
### Into 
Basically for most cases (no fancy $E=mc^{2}$ or $\frac{dm}{dt}_{system}\neq 0$) since mass cannot just disapear, mass in = mass out (mass is not created or destroyed). Using this fact we can derive useful equations for modelling flow in a system.

### Equation


### Proof
Given some shape we can define a bunch of equations to describe mass flow:

The volume in and volume out can be described using:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dV_{1}}{dt} &= A_{1} \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)_{1} \rho_{1} & \frac{dV_{1}}{dt} &= A_{1} \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)_{2} \rho_{1} \\
\frac{dV_{1}}{dt} &= A_{1} U_{1} \rho_{1} & \frac{dV_{1}}{dt} &= A_{1} U_{2} \rho_{1} 
\end{align*}$$
