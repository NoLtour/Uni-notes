#### Describe what occurs during
## Phase changes
### Energy changes
During a phase change there is usually an absorbtion or release of energy, this energy is released in some combination of work and heat. It resaults from the breaking/reforming of intermolecular bonds.
When a change of phase occurs at constant pressure and constant temperature the heat transferred per unit mass is called the [[latent heat]]. Note that [[latent heat]] is a function of both pressure and temperature.
