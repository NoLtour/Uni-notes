#### What are
## P-V diagrams
Also known as pressure, volume diagrams. I wonder if you can guess what two properties of a system they present, it's a really difficult thing to guess.
They are used to describe corresponding changes in volume and pressure in a system.

P-v diagrams are especially useful for describing [[process (thermodynamics)|processes]], this is because:
$$\begin{align*}
(\Delta p) \times (\Delta V) &= Energy 
\end{align*}$$
So for a process cycle (like that which exists in a heat engine):

We can find the theoretical work out by the area enclosed inside the diagram, with wasted energy being the area below the diagram.
