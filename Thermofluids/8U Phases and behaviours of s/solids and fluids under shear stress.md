#### What is the response of
## Solids and fluids under shear stress
If we start with a model of two infinite flat plates seperated by a narrow gap and between them we place either:
- An eleastic solid
- A [[viscous flow|viscous fluid]].

Now we apply a shear force on the top plate relative to the bottom plate:

#### Solids response
The solid reaches static [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] by balencing it's elastic reactive force against the shear force applied. The final state is described as static as nothing moves.
Hence solids can experience shear force when stationary or moving.

#### Fluids response
The fluid instead dosn't reach a point where it stops the movement of the plate, it does still provide a shear reaction but as friction through it's moving materials interaction with itself.
Hence fluids can only experience shear force when moving.
