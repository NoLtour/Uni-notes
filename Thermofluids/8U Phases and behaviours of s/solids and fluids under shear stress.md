#### What is the response of
## Solids and fluids under shear stress
If we start with a model of two large flat plates seperated by a narrow gap and between them we place either:
- An eleastic solid
- A [[viscous flow|viscous fluid]].

Now we apply a shear force on the top plate relative to the bottom plate:

#### Solids response
The solid reaches static [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] by balencing it's elastic reactive force against the shear force applied. The final state is described as static as nothing moves.

#### Fluids response
