#### What are
## Phase diagrams
A phase diagram is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at equilibrium. For example phase diagrams for water are:

On the second one the flat sections represent temperatures where forms with different densitys exist

Phase diagrams can also be 3D:
