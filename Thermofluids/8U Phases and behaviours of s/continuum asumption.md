#### What is the
## Continuum asumption
When applicable, the continuum assumption erases the molecular discontinuities by averaging the microscopic quantities on a small sampling volume. 
All macroscopic quantities of interest in classic fluid mechanics (density œÅ, velocity u, pressure p, temperature T, etc.) are assumed to vary continuously from point to point within the flow.
So we assume there are no instant changes in properites within the sample between adjasent points.

Of course like most things in thermodynamics on a small enough scale the [[continuum asumption]] isn't valid (because there isn't enough atoms to approximate continuum-ism-ish-ness (the technical term ofc) ).
