#### What is the
## Second law of thermodynamics
First of all the second law of thermodynamics is [[highly unbased]].

The second law of thermodynamics is a general principle which places constraints upon the direction of heat transfer and the attainable efficiencies of heat engines. 

It is impossible to extract an amount of heat $Q_H$ from a hot reservoir and use it all to do work W. Some amount of heat $Q_C$ must be exhausted to a cold reservoir. This precludes a perfect heat engine. In other words (or diagrams):

The second situation is not possible.
