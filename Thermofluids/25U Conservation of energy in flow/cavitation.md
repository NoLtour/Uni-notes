#### What is
## Cavitation
We know from [[conservation of energy in flow|conservation of energy in flow equation]] that it is possible to change the pressure of a fluid by changing it's velocity. Further from [[conservation of mass in flow|conservation of mass flow equation]] we know that constricting the cross section of the pipe can increase speed, so lets combine these two priciples to get a really skinny cross section and get some fluid to go [[ftl]]! Well you hit quite a few road blocks before that point and one of them is [[cavitation]]!
