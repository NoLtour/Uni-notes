#### What is
## Cavitation
### Intro
We know from [[conservation of energy in flow|conservation of energy in flow equation]] that it is possible to change the pressure of a fluid by changing it's velocity. Further from [[conservation of mass in flow|conservation of mass flow equation]] we know that constricting the cross section of the pipe can increase speed, so lets combine these two priciples to get a really skinny cross section and get some fluid to go [[ftl]]! Well you hit quite a few road blocks before that point and one of them is [[cavitation]].

### Description
Simply put cavitation is: "Drop in pressure from flow narrowing causes liquid to vaporise exploding, then pressure increase causes implosion", now heres something that's really unituitive... a shit tone of micro explosions and implosions in rapid succession aint good for machines, so the vast majority of the time cavitation just acts as another way for the universe to destroy our hard work [[enjoy bitch|:D]] ! 

It is important to consider that although most of the time when working with these concepts and equations we picutre pipes, we are really describing the flow channel thing, so any narrowing caused by propeller/turbine blades or even surrounding fluid flow can cause cavitation:

Also consider things like valves, they can also experience cavitation... it's a real pain in the ass!
