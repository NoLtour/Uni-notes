#### What is the equation and theory assosiated with
## Conservation of energy in flow
### Intro

Apply "energy can't be created or destroyed" to flow, there you go... you now know the theory!

([[idk stuff|yes that's it]])

### Proof

Here I'm using $A_{0}$ as the refrence point and $A$ to represent any cross sectional position, in reality $A_{0}$ is just as arbritry as $A$ and they both can be any cross section of the shape that has stuff flowing through it, I just like these letters [>\_<]. 

First we define the current potential energys of the fluid:

$$\begin{align*}
dE_{0} &= \frac{1}{2}dm_{0} U_{0}^{2} + h_{0} dm_{0} g + PV & &... \\
dE_{0} &= dm_{0}\left(\frac{1}{2} U_{0}^{2} + h_{0} g\right) + PV & &... \\
dE_{0} &= A_{0} dx_{0} \rho_{0}\left(\frac{U_{0}^{2}}{2}  + h_{0} g\right)  & &... \\
& & dE &= A dx \rho\left(\frac{U^{2}}{2}  + h g\right)
\end{align*}$$
