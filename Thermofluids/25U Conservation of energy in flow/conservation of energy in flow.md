#### What is the equation and theory assosiated with
## Conservation of energy in flow
### Intro

Apply "energy can't be created or destroyed" to flow, there you go... you now know the theory!

([[idk stuff|yes that's it]])

### Proof

Here we assume no energy losses to friction:

Here I'm using $A_{0}$ as the refrence point and $A$ to represent any cross sectional position, in reality $A_{0}$ is just as arbritry as $A$ and they both can be any cross section of the shape that has stuff flowing through it, I just like these letters [>\_<]. 


$$\begin{align*}

dE_{0} = \frac{1}{2}dm_{0} U_{0}^{2} & dE_{1} = \frac{1}{2}dm_{1} U_{1}^{2}\\
dE_{0} = \frac{1}{2} (A_{0} dx_{0} \rho_{0}) U_{0}^{2} 

\end{align*}$$
