## The 2 property rule
A rule used to uniquely define a system and requires specification of two independent properties (such as specific internal energy, specific volume, specific enthalpy, absolute temperature, and specific entropy).
All of the other properties can be found if the two independent properties are known. The properties are independent if one can be varied while the other does not change.

For example:
- if $p$ and $V$ are
