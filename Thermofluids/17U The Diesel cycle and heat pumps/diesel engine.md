#### What are the properties of a
## Diesel engine
### Main differences
The way that a diesel engine functions is very simular to a [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]], but there are some key differences:
- A diesel engine is a [[compression ignition engine]] while an [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]] is a [[spark ignition engine]].
- Fuel in a diesel engine is injected much closer to the [[reciprocating engines|TDC]] while in a [[the Otto cycle|Otto engine]] it is injected during the intake stroke
- Diesel is a much less volitile fuel (hence why spark ignition isn't used), so it is safer to store. It is also more energy dense.

### Combustion

Since in diesel engines the fuel is ignited via compression, the exact moment ignition occurs at varys each stroke which leads to slight inefficiency compared to perfectly controlled igni
