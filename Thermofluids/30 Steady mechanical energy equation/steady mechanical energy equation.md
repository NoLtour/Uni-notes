#### What is the
## Steady mechanical energy equation
Basically this is the same as the [[steady flow energy equation]] but it has some extra terms slapped on to account for mechanical losses.

> ### $$ \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = \int_{out}\left(C_{V} T + \frac{U^{2}}{2} + \frac{p}{\rho} + gz\right)\rho U\cdot dA - \int_{in}\left(C_{V} T + \frac{U^{2}}{2} + \frac{p}{\rho} + gz\right)\rho U\cdot dA$$ 
> ### $$ \dot{Q} - \dot{W} = \dot{m}\left( C_{V}T + \frac{p}{\rho} + gz \right)_{out} + \frac{1}{2} \int_{A_{in}} U^{2} \rho U \cdot dA - \dot{m}\left( C_{V}T + \frac{p}{\rho} + gz \right)_{out} - \frac{1}{2} \int_{A_{in}} U^{2} \rho U \cdot dA $$
>> where:
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $Q=$ [[heat]] transfer into system across the [[system boundary]] (positive is heat in)
>> $W=$ work done, ’non-fluid’ energy transfer. For example electrical work increasing the fluid pressure in a pump. (positive is work out, negative is work in [[UNFINISHED STUFF|not 100% sure]])
>> $m=$ mass
>> $U=$ speed
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $g=$ gravitational acceleration
>> $z=$ average height of cross section
>> $A=$ cross sectional area
