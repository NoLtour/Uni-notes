#### What is the
## Steady mechanical energy equation
### The equation
Basically this is the same as the [[steady flow energy equation]] but it has some extra terms slapped on to account for mechanical losses.

> ### $$ - \frac{\dot{W}}{m} = \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{out} - \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{in} + f \frac{L}{2d} \bar{U}^{2} + \sum\limits_{n} k_{n} \left(\frac{1}{2} \bar{U}^{2}\right) $$
>> where:
>> $W=$ work done, ’non-fluid’ energy transfer. For example electrical work increasing the fluid pressure in a pump. (positive is work out, negative is work in)
>>  $p=$ pressure
>>  $\rho=$ fluid density
>>  $g=$ acceleration due to gravity
>>  $z=$ height of centre of cross sectional area
>>  $\alpha=$ [[kinetic energy correction factor]]
>>  $d=$ pipe diameter
>>  $L=$ pipe length
>>  $f=$ emperical coefficient relating to friction
>>  $k_{n}=$ the coefficient relating to that specific energy loss
>>  $\bar{U}=$ velocity ([[UNFINISHED STUFF|not 100% sure if it dosn't have extra special meaning]])

A more simple form of the equation can be written as the following:
> ### $$ \dot{W}_{pump} - \dot{W}_{turbine} = \dot{m}\left( \left( \frac{p_{out}}{\rho} + \alpha_{out} \frac{V_{out}^{2}}{2} + gz_{out} \right) - \left( \frac{p_{in}}{\rho} + \alpha_{in} \frac{V_{in}^{2}}{2} + gz_{in} \right) \right) + \dot{E}_{mech\:loss} $$
>> where:
>> 


This equation only assumes [[steady flow]] and there are 2 ports, so it is widely applicable.

### Equation parts
The equation has lots of bits each with it's own meaning, so I'll break it down to be more understandable.

#### Energy stored in the fluid

$$ \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{out} - \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{in} $$
Represents the change in energy stored in the fluid (excluding heat), so pressure, kinetic and gpe are represented here.

#### Pipe frictional losses
$$ f \frac{L}{2d} \bar{U}^{2} $$

This uses a coefficient that is specific to the pipe $f$ to adjust for losses due to friction in the strait sections of pipe.

#### Fitting/joint losses
$$ \sum\limits_{n} k_{n} \left(\frac{1}{2} \bar{U}^{2}\right) $$
This represents all the losses due to the fluid moving around bends through valves ect, the coefficient $k_{n}$ is specific to the component that's being adjusted for, and since it's a sum function it can account for as many joints as need to be considered.

#### [[steady mechanical energy equation#Frictional losses|Pipe friction]] and [[steady mechanical energy equation#Fitting joint losses|fitting losses]]
$$ f \frac{L}{2d} \bar{U}^{2} + \sum\limits_{n} k_{n} \left(\frac{1}{2} \bar{U}^{2}\right) = C_{V}(T_{out} - T_{in} ) - \frac{\dot{Q}}{m} $$
Basically what this is saying is that the fitting and pipe friction is directly linked to heat change equations ([[define friction retard|I wonder why]])

#### Net work out
$$ - \frac{\dot{W}}{m} $$
Here positive values of $W$ represent work being extracted from the system while negative values indicate work being put into the system hence:
> ### $$ \dot{W} = \dot{W}_{turbine} - \dot{W}_{pump} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\dot{W}=$ The variable used in [[steady mechanical energy equation#^50e06c|the steady mechanical energy equation]]
>> $\dot{W}_{turbine}=$ Work done by the water on the turbine
>> $\dot{W}_{pump}=$ Work done by the pump on the water
