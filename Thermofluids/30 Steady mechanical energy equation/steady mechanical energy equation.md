#### What is the
## Steady mechanical energy equation
Basically this is the same as the [[steady flow energy equation]] but it has some extra terms slapped on to account for mechanical losses.

> ### $$ - \frac{\dot{W}}{m} = \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{out} - \left(\frac{p}{\rho} + gz + \frac{1}{2}\alpha \bar{U}^{2} \right)_{in} + f \frac{L}{2d} \bar{U}^{2} + \sum\limits_{n} k_{n} \left(\frac{1}{2} \bar{U}^{2}\right) $$
>> where:
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $Q=$ [[heat]] transfer into system across the [[system boundary]] (positive is heat in)
>> $W=$ work done, ’non-fluid’ energy transfer. For example electrical work increasing the fluid pressure in a pump. (positive is work out, negative is work in [[UNFINISHED STUFF|not 100% sure]])
>> $m=$ mass
>> $U=$ speed
>> $p=$ pressure
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $g=$ gravitational acceleration
>> $z=$ average height of cross section
>> $A=$ cross sectional area

This equation only assumes [[steady flow]] and there are 2 ports, so it is widely applicable.
