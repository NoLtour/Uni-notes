#### What is the
## Kinetic energy correction factor ($\alpha$)
Basically this thing is used to account for the uneven distrobution of mass flow through a cross section due to friction with the wall:

On the left is an ideal situation while the right is more realistic, so we don't have to deal with the headache of calculating it ourselves you usually get given it but heres the formula:

> ### $$ \alpha =  \frac{ KE_{actual\:velocity}}{KE_{average\:velocity}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} dm U^{2} }{\frac{1}{2} dm \bar{U}^{2} }= \frac{ U^{2} }{ \bar{U}^{2} } $$ 
> ### $$ \alpha \times KE_{average\:velocity} =  KE_{actual\:velocity}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $\alpha=$ [[kinetic energy correction factor]]
>> $KE_{average\:velocity}=$ the kinetic energy using the average velocity of a cross section
>> $KE_{actual\:velocity}=$ the actual kinetic energy through the cross section

So you know how in [[energy]]
