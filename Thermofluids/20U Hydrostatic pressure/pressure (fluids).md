#### What is
## Pressure (fluids)
The pressure due to the weight of the above fluid column can be determined using:
> ### $$ p = h\rho g $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ [[pressure (fluids)]]
>> $h=$ hight of column
>> $\rho=$ density of fluid
>> $g=$ gravity

For uncompressible fluids you can take $\rho$ as constant, but for gases you
