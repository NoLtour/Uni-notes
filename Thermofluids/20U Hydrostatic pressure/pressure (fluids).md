#### What is
## Pressure (fluids)
The pressure due to the weight of the above an uncompressible fluid column can be determined using:
> ### $$ p = h\rho g $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ [[pressure (fluids)]]
>> $h=$ hight of column
>> $\rho=$ density of fluid
>> $g=$ gravity

For uncompressible fluids you can take $\rho$ as constant, but for gases you might need to be more creative, this form should work:
> ### $$ d p = \rho(h) \times  g(h) \times d h $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ [[pressure (fluids)]]
>> $h=$ hight of column
>> $\rho(h)=$ density of fluid as a function of h
>> $g(h)=$ gravity as a function of h
