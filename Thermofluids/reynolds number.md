#### Define
## Reynolds number ($Re$)
The Reynolds number (Re) helps predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. With respect to laminar and turbulent flow regimes:
- laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion;
- turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce chaotic eddies, vortices and other flow instabilities.

The Reynolds number is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities. A region where these forces change behavior is known as a boundary layer, such as the bounding surface in the interior of a pipe. A similar effect is created by the introduction of a stream of high-velocity fluid into a low-velocity fluid, such as the hot gases emitted from a flame in air. This relative movement generates fluid friction, which is a factor in developing turbulent flow.

>> where:
>> $Re=$ [[reynolds number]] 
>> $U=$ flow speed
>> $\rho=$ fluid density
>> $\mu=$ [[dynamic viscosity]]
>> $\nu=$ [[kinematic viscosity]]
>> $L=$ characteristic linear dimension (This dimension is a matter of convention â€“ for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe, or for a sphere moving in a fluid, the internal diameter is generally used today.)
