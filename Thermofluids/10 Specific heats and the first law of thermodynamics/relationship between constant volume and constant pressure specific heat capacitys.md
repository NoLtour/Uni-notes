#### What is the
## Relationship between constant volume and constant pressure specific heat capacitys
> ### $$ C_P = C_V + R $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_P=$  [[specific heat capacity]] for a constant pressure
>> $C_V=$ [[specific heat capacity]] for a constant volume
>> $R =$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
