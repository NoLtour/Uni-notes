#### What's the theory behined
## Controlling work done when heating
### Intro
When working with heating this fact should be kept in mind:
![[equation for change in internal energy]]

So to effectively heat something with the goal of increasing temperature, you want to maxamise the change in [[internal energy]] while minamising the work done by the system. (sometimes the opposite may also be true, depending on requirements ofc)

### Volume changes and work done
We know according to the [[ideal gas law]] that if you increase somethings temperature then it's pressure or vo
