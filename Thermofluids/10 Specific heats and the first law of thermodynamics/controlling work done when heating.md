#### What's the theory behined
## Controlling work done when heating
### Intro
When working with heating this fact should be kept in mind:
![[equation for change in internal energy]]

So to effectively heat something with the goal of increasing temperature, you want to maxamise the change in [[internal energy]] while minamising the work done by the system. (sometimes the opposite may also be true, depending on requirements ofc)

### Volume changes and work done
We know according to the [[ideal gas law]] that if you increase somethings temperature then it's pressure or volume will also increase ($\frac{pV}{T}=k$) but when a container expands whether that be in something like a baloon or a piston work is done to expand that volume, this work done decreases the energy that goes into heating the substance.

#### Heating at constant volume
So if you instead heat something at a constant volume in a sealed container then no work is done on the container ($E=Fx$) with no change in distance no work can be done. Hence more of the [[heat]] is used to increase internal energy and hence temperature.

#### Gas internal energy
If we now do some more detailed math to express this:
$$\begin{align*}
  E_u &=\frac{3}{2}Nk_B T\\
 &= \frac{3}{2} k_B T\\
&= \frac{3}{2} mRT\\
&= m C_V T\\
e_u &=C_V T
\end{align*}$$
$\therefore e_u =C_V T$ is only true for atoms.

$C_V$ is the [[specific heat capacity]] for a constant volume.

### Constant pressure and work done

The energy used when expanding one face of a box is:
$$ \begin{align*}
\Delta W &= F \Delta x\\
&= pA \Delta x\\
&= p \Delta V & p\Delta V&=mR\Delta T\\
&= mR\Delta T
\end{align*}  $$
(Here we used a form of the [[ideal gas law]])

![[relationship between constant volume and constant pressure specific heat capacitys]]

We can then form: $C_P=C_V+R$ 

Here $C_P$ is the [[specific heat capacity]] for a constant pressure, and $C_V$ is the [[specific heat capacity]] for a constant volume.
