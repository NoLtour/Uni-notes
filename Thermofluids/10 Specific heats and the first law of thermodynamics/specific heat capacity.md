#### What is
## Specific heat capacity ($C$)
This is the change in internal energy required to increase the temperature of 1kg of a given substance by 1K. 
Specific heat capacity usually changes with temperature, if a gas has a constant specific heat for all temperatures we call it a [[perfect gas]].

There are multiple types of specific heat capacity:
- $C_V$ Specific heat for constant volume
- $C_p$ Specific heat for constant pressure
