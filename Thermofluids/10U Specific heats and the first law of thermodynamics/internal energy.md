#### What is
## Internal energy ($U$,$E_u$)
This is the energy contained within a thermodynamic system.

For an ideal gas:

> ### $$ dE_{u} = n C_{v}\cdot dT $$ 
> ### $$ \Delta E_{u} = n C_{v}\cdot \Delta T $$ 
>> where:
>> $E_{u}=$ [[internal energy]]
>> $n=$ number of moles
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $T=$ absolute temperature
