#### What is the
## Specific heat ratio ($\gamma$)
This is the ratio between the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] for constant volume vs constant pressure:

> ### $$ \gamma = \frac{C_P}{C_V} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\gamma=$ Specific heat ratio
>> $C_V=$ Specific heat for constant volume
>> $C_P=$ Specific heat for constant pressure
