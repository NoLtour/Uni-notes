#### What is
## Specific heat capacity ($C$)

> ### $$ \Delta Q = mc(\Delta T) $$ 
>> where:
>> $\Delta Q=$ Heat added to substance
>> $m=$ mass of substance
>> $c=$ [[specific heat capacity]]
>> $\Delta T=$ change in temperature

This is the change in internal energy required to increase the temperature of 1kg of a given substance by 1K. 
Specific heat capacity usually changes with temperature, if a gas has a constant specific heat for all temperatures we call it a [[perfect gas]].

There are multiple types of specific heat capacity:
- [[constant volume specific heat]] ($C_v$)
- [[constant pressure specific heat]] ($C_p$)
