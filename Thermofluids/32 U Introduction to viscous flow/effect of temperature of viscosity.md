#### What is the
## Effect of temperature of viscosity
Viscosity in fluids is a consequence of molecular motion and hence intermolecular forces, so heres a [[I am running out of dumb things to add as hidden messages so heres a life hack instead|real shocker]] if you fuck with intermolecular forces by increasing the temperature viscosity changes:
- In gasses viscosity generally increases with an increase in temp
- In liquids viscosity generally decreases with an increase in temp
