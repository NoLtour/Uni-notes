#### Describe
## Newtonian fluids
This is a model for [[viscous flow|viscous fluids]] where shear stress is proprotional to rate of shear strain, or put another way shear stress is proprotional to relative velocity between layers in a fluid.
When modelling [[newtonian fluids]] we often also take the [[continuum asumption]] for layers of particles:

Because else creating a models kinda not really practical, unless you have some supercomputer.
