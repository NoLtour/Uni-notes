#### Describe
## Newtonian fluids
This is a model for [[viscous flow|viscous fluids]] where shear stress is proprotional to rate of shear strain, or put another way shear stress is proprotional to relative velocity between layers in a fluid.
When modelling [[newtonian fluids]] we often also take the [[continuum asumption]] for layers of particles:

Because else creating a models kinda not really practical, unless you have some supercomputer. 

Heres what I've been writing but as an equation:

> ### $$ \tau = A \mu \times dV $$ 
>> where:
>> $\tau=$ shear stress
>> $A=$ area of the adjasent layers
>> $\mu=$ [[shear viscosity of the fluid]] [[UNFINISHED STUFF|(not sure if needs a page)]] 
>> $dV=$ difference in velocity between two adjasent layers
