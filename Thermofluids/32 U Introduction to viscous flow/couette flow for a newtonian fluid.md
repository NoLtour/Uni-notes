#### Describe
## Couette flow for a newtonian fluid
Using the theory from [[newtonian fluids]] and applying it to [[couette flow]] we can demonstrate it's application under a simple situation:

So the top plate is moving with a velocity $V_{0}$ and the bottom is stationary, if we take the [[fluid no slip condition]] into account then we know that a very thin layer adjastent to both the top and bottom layers is moving with the same velocity it's got. So lets turn these ideas into math:
$$\begin{align*}
at\:x&=0 & at\:x&=D\\
V &= V_{0}  & V&=0
\end{align*}$$
Where $V$ is the velocity of a thin layer of fluid and $x$ is distance normal to the top layer.
We can take fluid layer thickness as thin $(dx)$ and the difference in velocity between adjasent layers as $dV$
