#### Define
## Couette flow
In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is the flow of a [[viscous flow|viscous]] fluid in the space between two surfaces, one of which is moving tangentially relative to the other. The relative motion of the surfaces imposes a shear stress on the fluid and induces flow. Depending on the definition of the term, there may also be an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction.
