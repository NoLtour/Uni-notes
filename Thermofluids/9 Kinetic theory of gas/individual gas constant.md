#### What's a
## Individual gas constant ($R$)
This is a constant that is specific to a gas relating its molecular weight to the [[universal gas constant]].

> ### $$ R= \frac{R_u}{m_u} $$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ Individual gas constant
>> $R_u=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $m_u=$ specific molecular weight

Note for air it is 287
