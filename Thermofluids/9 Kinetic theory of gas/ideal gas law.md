#### What is the
## Ideal gas law
It's proved in [[pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas|this page]].

### Assumptions
1) The particles are rigid, with no momentum or time being lost during collisions
2) The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume
3) The force between adjacent particles is negligible

These hold true for most common situations, but high: temp's, pressures or densitys can [[this is the technical term|fuck it up]]. When this occurs you can usually use the [[Van der Waals equation]].

Also in an ideal gas temperature is a function of internal energy of the gas, so if there is no change in total internal energy (no work is done) then temperature dosn't change.

### Useful (Based) forms of the equation

> ### $$ p\rho =  RT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ pV =  mRT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $m=$ mass of gas
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

### Trash (Cringe) forms of the equation
![[Cringe]]

> ### $$ pV = Nk_B T \:\:\: or \:\:\: E =\frac{3}{2}Nk_B T $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $N=$ Number of particles
>> $k_B=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
>> $E=$ [[internal energy]] of gas

> ### $$ pV = nR_uT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $n=$ mol of gas
>> $R_u=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
