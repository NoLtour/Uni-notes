#### What is the
## Relationship between laminar flow and surface friction
In laminar flow (charcterised by a low [[reynolds number]]) the velocity varies smoothly between the bulk of the fluid and the pipe surface (where the [[fluid no slip condition]] applies):

The roughness of the pipe surface influences neither the fluid flow nor the friction loss. It also should be noted the [[effect of viscosity on flow]].
