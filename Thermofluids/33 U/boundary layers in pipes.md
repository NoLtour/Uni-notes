#### Describe
## Boundary layers in pipes
We know that [[boundary layer]]s start out laminar and can transition into turbulance, but depending on several factors such as [[viscosity]] and [[relative roughness]] it may not transition into turbulance and instead maintain laminar flow through the pipe.

As expected the [[boundary layer]] starts out laminar, it
