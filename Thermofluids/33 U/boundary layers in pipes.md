#### Describe
## Boundary layers in pipes
We know that [[boundary layer]]s start out laminar and can transition into turbulance, but depending on several factors such as [[viscosity]] and [[relative roughness]] it may not transition into turbulance and instead maintain laminar flow through the pipe.

### Turbulent flow

The [[boundary layer]] starts out laminar, then it transitions into turbulent flow. In pipes turbulent flow is characterised by a U shaped velocity profile, note that the shape of the velocity profile is what gets used in determining the [[kinetic energy correction factor]] and is applicable to both turbulent and laminar flow in pipes.

### Laminar flow

Here the [[boundary layer]] doesn't transition into turbulent flow. The flow is characterised by the parabella shaped velocity profile. This type of flow resaults in much more efficient flow with less internal friction and less skin drag resaulting in much lower pressure loss.

### Determining conditions
Many factors effect what type of flow is developed but mainly:
- [[viscosity]]
- [[relative roughness]]
- flow speed
- (I would also assume density)

Both [[viscosity]] and flow speed directly feed into [[reynolds number]] which can then be used to predict turbulent transition.

#### Viscosity
More [[viscous flow|viscous]] fluids don't create [[eddy (fluids)|eddies]] as easily and are in general less likely to develop into turbulent flow, hence less viscous fluids are more likely to develop turbulence. This is due to the fact that the effect of internal shear forces on flow exceeds the effect of the roughness.

A more viscous fluid also "smooths" over the roughness better, like imagine a really rough pipe but with the outer wall coated in honey, it smooths the walls making flow easyer.

#### Relative roughness
A higher [[relative roughness]] contributes to increased likelyhood of development of turbu
