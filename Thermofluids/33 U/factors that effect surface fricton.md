#### What are the
## Factors that effect surface fricton
### Intro
There are 2 things:
- [[reynolds number|Reynolds number]]
- [[relative roughness]]


### Reynolds number
Reynolds number is determined by lots of other properties of the fluid, so think of it's contribution to the surface friction as the contribution of the properties of the fluid and its movement characteristics.
