#### What is the
## Boundary layer
### Introduction
This is a layer of fluid near the rough surface that the fluid is interacting with in which the velocity of the fluid changes between the [[freestream]] velocity and the velocity adjastent to the surface (which would be zero due to the [[fluid no slip condition]]):

In the images above the boundary layer is everything below the limit of boundary layer.

### Types of boundary layer
One of the most important descriptors of a boundary layer is at what points it's laminar or turbulent. Boundary layers generally start out in laminar flow and transition into turbulant flow as seen in the diagrams above, but depending on various factors there my not even be substantial turbulant flow within the boundary layer resaulting in a laminar boundary layer.
Here is an example with an aerofoil, you can see in the rightmist diagram no 


### Boundary layer in pipes
In pipes the boundary layer forms around the entire diameter and converges:

Although the flow maintains a [[turbulent flow regime]] it can be described using an average flow profile, this is what goes into things like the [[kinetic energy correction factor]]. 
What you will also notice is that the flow profile changes as you go down the pipe, with it eventially tending towords a final fully developed state:
