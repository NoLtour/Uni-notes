#### What is the
## Boundary layer
This is a layer of fluid near the rough surface that the fluid is interacting with in which the velocity of the fluid changes between the [[freestream]] velocity and the velocity adjastent to the surface (which would be zero due to the [[fluid no slip condition]]):

In the images above the boundary layer is everything below the limit of boundary layer.
In pipes the boundary layer forms around the entire diameter and converges:

Although the flow maintains a [[turbulent flow regime]] you can see the average flow profile, this is what goes into things like the [[kinetic energy correction factor]]
