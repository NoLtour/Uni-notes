#### What is the
## Darcy-weisbach friction factor ($f_{D}$)
This is the friction factor we use. It is the 


For laminar flow it's easy to find:

> ### $$ f_{D} = \frac{64}{Re} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Re=$ [[reynolds number]] 
>> $f_{D}=$ [[darcy-weisbach friction factor]]
>> Pipe has circular cross section

But for turbulent refer to [[moody diagram]].
