#### What is the
## Darcy-weisbach friction factor ($f_{D}$)
This is the friction factor we use. It is basically a way of finding head loss due to surface friction (by slapping this thing into [[head loss darcy weisbach equation|this other equation (thing)]]).

For laminar flow it's easy to find ([[relative roughness]] doesn't factor because in laminar flow the effect of skin friction and related phenomina are negligible):

> ### $$ f_{D} = \frac{64}{Re} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Re=$ [[reynolds number]] 
>> $f_{D}=$ [[darcy-weisbach friction factor]]
>> Pipe has circular cross section

But for turbulent refer to [[moody diagram]].
