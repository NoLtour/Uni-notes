#### Describe the relationship between
## Surface roughness and flow on a micro scale
First of all the [[fluid no slip condition]] applies so we know that directly adjasent to the wall the fluid is stationary, this also means that nearby flow is slow hence resaulting in a low [[reynolds number]] and laminar flow adjasent to the wall (this is known as the [[features of the boundary layer|viscous sublayer]] in [[boundary layer|boundary layers]]).
