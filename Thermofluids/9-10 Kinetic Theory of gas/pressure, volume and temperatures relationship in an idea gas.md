#### How can we relate
## Pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas
Using [[calculating the pressure of a gas molecule|this proof]] along with [[relationship between temperature and kinetic energy of particles|this equation]]

![[calculating the pressure of a gas molecule#^3c65ed]]

![[relationship between temperature and kinetic energy of particles#^2669d3]]

I wonder how these equations combine :thinking: :
$$\begin{align*}
   KE_{particle}& = \frac{3}{2} k_B T\\
pV=\frac{2N}{3}KE_{particle}&\\
pV=\frac{2N}{3}\frac{3}{2} k_B T&\\
\therefore pV = Nk_B T
\end{align*}$$

This is a form of the [[ideal gas law]].
