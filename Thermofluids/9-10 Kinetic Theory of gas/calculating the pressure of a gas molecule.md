I reiterate, boyles law ect = trash. Just use the one we are about to make (I really don't know why we learn about obsolete equations, too many names to remember).

### Modelling a molecule of gas

First lets take a molecule of gas in a box with sides of length $L$.

When it hits a wall it bounces off with an equal but negative momentum so:

momentum before + momentum change = momentum after

$$\begin{align*}
   m_a u_x + -m_a u_x &=  
\end{align*}$$
