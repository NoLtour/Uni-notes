#### What is the
## Relationship between temperature and kinetic energy of particles

> ### $$ KE_{particle} = \frac{3}{2} k_B T $$ 
>> where:
>> $KE_{particle}=$ The average kinetic energy of a particle
>> $k_b=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature (Kelvin)

In reallity temperature isn't really a thing
