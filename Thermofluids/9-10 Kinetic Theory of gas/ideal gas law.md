#### What is the
## Ideal gas law
It's proved in [[pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas|this page]].

> ### $$ pV = Nk_B T $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $N=$ Number of particles
>> $k_B=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ pV = nRT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $n=$ mol of gas
>> $R=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
