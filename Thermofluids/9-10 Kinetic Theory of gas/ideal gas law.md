#### What is the
## Ideal gas law
It's proved in [[pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas|this page]].


### Useful forms of the equation

> ### $$ pV =  mRT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $m=$ mass of gas
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ p\rho =  RT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
>> 
### Trash forms of the equation

> ### $$ pV = Nk_B T $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $N=$ Number of particles
>> $k_B=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ pV = nR_uT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $n=$ mol of gas
>> $R_u=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
