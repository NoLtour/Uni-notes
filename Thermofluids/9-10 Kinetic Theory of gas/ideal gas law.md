#### What is the
## Ideal gas law
It's proved in [[pressure, volume and temperatures relationship in an idea gas|this page]].

### Assumptions
1) The particles are rigid, with no momentum or time being lost during collisions
2) The volume of the particles is negligible compared to the total volume
3) The force between adjacent particles is neglibile

These hold true for most common situations, but high temp's, pressures and densitys can [[this is the technical term|fuck it up]].

### Useful forms of the equation

> ### $$ p\rho =  RT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ pV =  mRT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $m=$ mass of gas
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

### Trash forms of the equation

> ### $$ pV = Nk_B T $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $N=$ Number of particles
>> $k_B=$ [[Boltzmann constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature

> ### $$ pV = nR_uT $$ 
>> where:
>> $p=$ Pressure of gas
>> $V=$ Volume of gas
>> $n=$ mol of gas
>> $R_u=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $T=$ Temperature
