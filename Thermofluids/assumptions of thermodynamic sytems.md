#### What are the
## Assumptions of thermodynamic sytems
- A property of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] has only one value for a given thermodynamic state. 
- The thermodynamic state of a system is defined by the values of all its properties. 
- A change of state involves a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]]. 
- [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|Equilibrium]] exists when there is no tendency for the state of a system to change with time. 

Note that we often equate [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] and [[quasi-equilibrium (thermodynamics)|quasi-equalibrium]]
