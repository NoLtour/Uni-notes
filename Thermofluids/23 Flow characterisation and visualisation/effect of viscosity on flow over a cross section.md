#### What is the
## Effect of viscosity on flow over a cross section
Bascially as you get near to walls velocity decreases, in some cases adjasent to the wall can have basically no net movement, it is also possible to get increased turbulance as you approach a wall. 
This can be seen effectively in the following chart, where a [[viscous flow|viscous]] fluid moved over a rough bed of gravel. The velocity decreases as you approach the bottom, but above a certain height the velocity is basically constant:

This is due to the fluid being [[viscous flow|viscous]] and the particles transfering velocity to eachother creating a continous velocity gradient.
