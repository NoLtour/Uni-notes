#### What are
## Vector fields
#### Description
Basically the vector version of a [[scalar fields|scalar field]], hence each point has a vector value assosiated with it, once again the path taken to that point doesn't effect the value of that point:

> ## $$ \vec{f}_{VF}(x,y,z) = f_{1}(x,y,z) \hat{i} + f_{2}(x,y,z) \hat{j} + f_{3}(x,y,z) \hat{k} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}=$ [[unit vector]]s associated with x,y,z directions
>> $\vec{f}_{VF}=$ function of vector field
>> $f_{1,2,3}=$ artistry functions

#### Representation
Simular to a [[scalar fields|scalar field]] except for [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]], so you can use colour and arrows:

If trying to represent flow, they give much more useful information than just [[scalar fields]], so are [[very neat infact|neat]].
