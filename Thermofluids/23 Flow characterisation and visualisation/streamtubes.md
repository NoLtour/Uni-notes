#### What are
## Streamtubes
Basically just a collection of [[streamlines]] that create a continous surface and hence form a tube. Since [[streamlines]] cannot cross eachother, any mass that enters one side of a [[streamtubes|streamtube]] must come out the other end of the [[streamtubes|streamtube]]:

Hence a smooth pipe could be represented using one of these.

If we have steady incompressible flow then the cross section of the [[streamtubes|streamtube]] can be used to describe pressure and velocity changes:
