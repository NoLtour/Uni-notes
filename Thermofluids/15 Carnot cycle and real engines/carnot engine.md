#### What is the
## Carnot engine
#### Simpler desc
Basically this is a ideal engine, it is frinctionless, insulated in a perfect way ect. The processes behave perfectly and the gas is ideal, this is a model of "the perfect engine", by looking at how it works and comparing it to real engines we can get idea's on where we loose efficiency and how we can improve.

### How it works
![[Pasted image 20220104134434.png]]

It consists of:
1)  ($1 \to 2$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal compression]], work is done on the gas causing heat to flow out of the gas to the low temp reserviour.
2) ($2 \to 3$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic compression]], work is done on the gas compressing it and increasing it's temp.
3) ($3 \to 4$) [[reversible and irreversible processes|Reversible]] [[isothermal expansion or compression|isothermal expansion]], heat is transferred to the gas expanding it and the gas preforms work.
4) ($4 \to 1$) [[isentropic process|Isentropic]] expansion, the gas continues to expand preforming work without any heat transfer.

#### Properties
- Fully reversible
- Consists of 4 processes
- It is a frictionless piston cylinder arrangement with perfectly insulated walls
- It is a theoreticall engine based on what would be theoretically most efficient, hence not really possible
- All heat transfer occurs between gas and heat sink/source
- Since it is reversible efficiency can be found using [[efficiency of a heat cycle#^a48207]]
