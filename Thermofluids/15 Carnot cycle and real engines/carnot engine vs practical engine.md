## [[carnot engine|Carnot engine]] vs practical engine
(I'm not going to define [[this is not a definition it is a shitpost|practical engine]], because I considering what carnot engines are I think you can guess what practical means)

Heres a real shocker for you, turns out the model of a perfect engine is more efficient than real world engines (*shock*):

This is due to shit tones of things:
- Friction within the fluids
- Friction just generally
- Non desired heat transfers

Friction leads to irreversible losses at every step.
