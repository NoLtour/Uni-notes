#### What are
## Reciprocating engines
### Basic def
A reciprocating engine, also often known as a piston engine, is typically a heat engine that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion.
(Or [[I can not believe that you assume I would be shitposting though I am|my personal definition]] a engine that goes brrrrr (but spinny brrr). )

### Elaboration
![[Pasted image 20220104143631.png]]

The general function is:
- A piston moves between bottom and top dead centre (BDC and TDC)
- Fuel is injected which combusts driving the piston
- It cycles clearing exhuast expanding and compressing gas to extract work which drives some shaft

### Terms
These are terms related to [[reciprocating engines]] that you should be able to define/describe:
- [[clearance volume (engines)]]
- [[total volume (engines)]]
- [[volume compression ratio (engines)]]
- [[spark ignition engine]]
- [[compression ignition engine]]
- [[cylinder (engines)]]
- [[geometric cylinder arrangement terms (engines)]]
- [[compression ignition]]
- [[spark ignition]]

Yes there are quite a lot, and yes you should know them. [[wait shit I also need to learn them|Suffer bitch.]]
