#### What is a
## Quasi-equilibrium process
This is a [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] that changes the state of a [[system (thermodynamics)|system]] slowly enough that the system can be described as in [[quasi-equilibrium (thermodynamics)|quasi-equilibrium]].

For example if you compressed gas in a cylinder slowly enough that it's temperature remains uniform.
