## The rocket equation

### The equation

> ### $$ \Delta V = V_{ex} \ln\left( \frac{M_{0}}{M_{b}} \right) $$ 
> ### $$ V = V_{ex} \ln\left( \frac{M_{0}}{M} \right) + V_{0} $$ 
>> where:
>> $V=$ current rocket velocity
>> $V_{ex}=$ exhaust velocity
>> $M_{0}=$ initial rocket mass
>> $M_{b}=$ final rocket mass
>> $M=$ current mass
>> $V_{0}=$ initial rocket velocity

The equation's quite simple, it just represents how much push you get for the stuff you throw below you. No matter how fancy your propulsion method this equation is what enables all rockets to move (unless your some sort of [[space boat cringe|cringe solar sail]]).
