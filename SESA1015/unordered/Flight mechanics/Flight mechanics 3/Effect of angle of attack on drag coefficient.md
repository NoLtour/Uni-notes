#### What is
## Effect of angle of attack on drag coefficient
The typical variation is shown below:

The value of $C_D$ at the [[no lift angle]] is called the [[profile drag coefficient]], hence there's the equation:

> $$ C_D = C_Do + C_Di $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_D =$ [[Drag coefficient]]
>> $C_Do =$ [[profile drag coefficient]]
>> $C_Di =$ [[induced drag coefficient]]
