#### What is
## Aerodynamic centre
This is defined as the reference axis position about which the pitching moment coefficient does not  vary with angle of attack. In maths terms:
$$ \frac{dM_{AC}}{d\alpha}=0 $$

This is the position at which the force and moment acting could be replaced by a constant pitching moment ($M_0$) and this together with a lifting force (the lifting force varies)
