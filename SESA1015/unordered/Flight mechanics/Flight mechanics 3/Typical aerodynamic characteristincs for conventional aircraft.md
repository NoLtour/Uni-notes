# Typical aerodynamic characteristincs for conventional aircraft
This section covers typical aerodynamic characteristics of a conventional aircraft with an unswept wing and conventional tailplaine. These descriptions do not factor in the effects of air's compressability and are not applicible to high speeds (approaching supersonic and above).
