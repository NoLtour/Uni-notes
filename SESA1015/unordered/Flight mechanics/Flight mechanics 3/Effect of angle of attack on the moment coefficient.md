#### What is the
## Effect of angle of attack on the moment coefficient

Pressure moves with the angle of attack, which effects the [[Pitching moment coefficient]].

The slope of the graph relating to angle of attack also depends on the point the moment is taken about:

The variation of the [[Pitching moment coefficient]] is:

> $$ C_m = C_{mo} - h C_L $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_m =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]]
>> $C_{mo} =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]] at zero lift
>> $h =$ a constant
>> $C_L =$ [[Lift coefficient]]

For an aircraft to be trimmed it must have no pitching moment about the centre of gravity, hence to achieve this the curve when plotted for the centre of gravity must cross the horizontal axis ()
