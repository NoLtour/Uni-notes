#### What is the
## Effect of angle of attack on the moment coefficient
#### How the angle of attack effects forces on the airfoil
Pressure moves with the angle of attack, which effects the [[Pitching moment coefficient]].

#### How the angle of attack effects moments
The slope of the graph relating to angle of attack also depends on the [[measuring pitching moments on a plane|point the moments is taken about]]:

#### Mathamatical representation
The variation of the [[Pitching moment coefficient]] is:

> $$ C_m = C_{mo} - h C_L $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_m =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]]
>> $C_{mo} =$ [[Pitching moment coefficient]] at zero lift
>> $h =$ a constant
>> $C_L =$ [[Lift coefficient]]

This shows that the moment coefficient varys with the [[Lift coefficient]] whic
