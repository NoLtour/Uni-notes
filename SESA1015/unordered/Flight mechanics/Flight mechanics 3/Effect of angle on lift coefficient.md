#### What is the
## Effect of angle on lift coefficient
[[Lift coefficient]] increases approximately linearly with the angle of attack to about 10-15 degrees; once your angle of attack it too great the flow seperates from the wing, the lift coefficient stops rising and then begins to drop sharply.
The typical behaviour is shown here:

$\alpha_0$ is called the [[no lift angle]] and is usually negative.
