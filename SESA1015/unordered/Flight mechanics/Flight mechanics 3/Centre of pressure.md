#### What is
## Centre of pressure
This is the axis position about which the pitching moment ($M_{cp}$) is zero. It is the position at which the resaultant lift of the wing plus body appears to act with zero moment. The positions of the centre of pressure moves as the angle of attack changes.

(also fuck you, I'm not cropping out the random text refer to [[why I cant be asked]])

Taking moments about the centre of gravity:

$$ M_{CG} = x_{CP}L $$

Then if we divide by $\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}Sc$ and use $C_m = C_{mo}-hC_L$ (from [[Effect of angle of attack on the moment coefficient#^cfc8b1]]):

> $$ C_{CG} = \dfrac{x_{CP}}{c}C_L = C_m - hC_L $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{CG} =$ your mum
>> $x_{CP} =$ distance between centre of pressure and centre of gravity
>> $c =$ [[Mean chord|Mean aerodynamic chord]]
>> $C_L =$ [[Lift coefficient]]
>> $h =$ a constant
