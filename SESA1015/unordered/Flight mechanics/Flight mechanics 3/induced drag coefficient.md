#### What causes the
## induced drag coefficient
This is caused from the downwash the wing uses to produce lift, it increases in proportion to the square of the [[Lift coefficient]] with a relationship of:

> $$ C_{Di} = k C_L^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_{Di} =$ induced drag coefficient
>> $k =$ a constant
>> $C_L =$ [[Lift coefficient]]

The constant $k$ from above can be calculated using:

> $$ k = \frac{K}{\pi A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K =$ another constant
>> $A =$ [[Wing aspect ratio]]

This new constant $K$ depends on the planform shape of the wing. For elliptic wings (These have the lowest induced drag of all planforms) the value of $K$ is exactly 1. ^fce277
