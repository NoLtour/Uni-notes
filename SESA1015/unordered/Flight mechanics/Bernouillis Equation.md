#### What is the
## Bernouillis Equation
This is simplified and ignores GPE (but that's not important for our usecase so can be ignored)
> $$ k = p + \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 $$ 
>> where:
>> $k =$ stagnation pressure
>> $p =$ static pressure
>> $V =$ velocity of flow ($m/s$)
>> $\rho =$ density

It assumes that:
* Fluid is incompressible
* No work is done by the fluid
* No heat transfer into the fluid
