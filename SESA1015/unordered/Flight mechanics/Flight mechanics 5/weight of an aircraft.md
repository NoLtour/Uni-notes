#### What comprises
## Weight of an aircraft
This equation tells you everything you need to know:

> ### $$ W = W_s + W_f $$ 
>> where:
>> $W=$ Total aircraft weight at a given time
>> $W_s=$ Weight of dry aircraft
>> $W_f=$ Weight of fuel

At the start of the journey the fuel is at a maximum, so usually in an equation $W_f$ refers to starting amount of fuel.
