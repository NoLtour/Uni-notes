#### Whats the method for
## Calculating range in the statosphere
#### Intro
Although we know from [[min drag in steady level flight|you basically get free fuel by flying higher]], but sadly this relationship dosn't last forever. As you start to approach the [[speed of sound]] air will begin to move at supersonic speeds around various parts of the plane, this causes lots of issues with aerodynamics limiting aircraft to only flying at speeds a certain amount below the [[speed of sound]]. ([[based engineering|note that as engineers it is our job to say "fuck you" to what science says we can do]])

We can also assume that mach number is constant according to [[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]], atleast within the stratsophere (since temperature is constant {that's what is says in the notes but google says }).

#### Applying this to range equation
We basically just combine:
![[Breguet range equation#^20c05c]]

![[Mach number#^7ad944]]
