#### What is
## Specific fuel consumption (aircraft)
This is the weight of fuel used per unit time to produce unit thrust. (this sfc is very different to the sfc definition used by mechanical engineers, but that's not important they are simply wrong {[[god just saying that makes me cringe but yeah based|aero gang]]} )
