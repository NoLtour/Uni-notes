#### What is
## Equivalent Airspeed

It is defined as the speed at sea level (using the [[International Standard Atmosphere]]) that would produce the same incompressible [[dynamic pressure]] as the [[True airspeed]] at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying.

> $$ \text{True Airspeed} * \sqrt{\text{Relative Density}} = \text{Equivalent Airspeed} $$
