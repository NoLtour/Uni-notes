#### What is
## Equivalent Airspeed

It is defined as the speed at sea level (using the [[ISO]]) that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying

> $$ \text{True Airspeed} * \sqrt{\text{Relative Density}} = \text{Equivalent Airspeed} $$
