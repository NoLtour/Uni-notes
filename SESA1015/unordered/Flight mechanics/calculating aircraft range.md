#### How would you go about
## Calculating aircraft range
We can use the equation from [[the rate at which aircraft weight decreases]]:

![[the rate at which aircraft weight decreases#^5a7c77]]

We can rearrange it:
$$\begin{align*}
    \frac{dW(t)}{dt} &= -sW \frac{C_D}{C_L}\\
&= \frac{dW}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt}\\
&= V \frac{dW}{dx}
\end{align*}$$
