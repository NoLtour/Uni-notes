#### What is
## Stalling speed
This is the minimum speed at which the aricraft can fly (before stalling and dropping out the fucking sky).
It occurs when the [[Lift coefficient]] reaches it's maximum ($C_L = C_Lmax$), you can express stalling speed by subbing into the equation from [[steady flight and true airspeed#^34c139]].

>> where:
>> $V_S=$ Stalling speed
>> $C_{Lmax}=$ max $C_L$
>> $\rho=$ air density
>> $w=$ [[wing loading]]

It should be noted that with a constant wing loading and max lift coefficient, the true air speed at the stall increases as the air density decreases (at higher altitudes you can go faster).
It should also be noted that the [[Equivalent Airspeed]] at stall remains constant with altitude $\frac{V_E}{V} = V * \sqrt{\rho}$
