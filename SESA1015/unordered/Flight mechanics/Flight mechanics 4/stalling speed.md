#### What is
## Stalling speed
This is the minimum speed at which the aricraft can fly (before stalling and dropping out the fucking sky).
It occurs when the [[Lift coefficient]] reaches it's maximum ($C_L = C_Lmax$), you can express stalling speed by subbing into the equation from [[steady flight and true airspeed^]]
