#### How would you go about
## Calculating minimum drag
### Conditions
We can work under the same assumtions from [[steady flight and true airspeed#Conditions]].

### Calcualations
We know that drag can be found using:
![[Drag equation#^33fc8d]]

Subbing in for $$:
![[Drag coefficient#^e6ae2f]]

We get
