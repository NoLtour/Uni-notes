#### How would you go about
## Calculating minimum drag
### Conditions
We can work under the same assumtions from [[steady flight and true airspeed#Conditions]].

### Calcualations
We know that drag can be found using:
[[Drag equation#^33fc8d]]

Subbing in for $C_D$ with:
[[Drag coefficient#^e6ae2f]]

Then subbing in $C_{Di}$ with:
[[induced drag coefficient#^4d0b00]]
[[induced drag coefficient#^438b96]]

We get:
$$D = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S (C_{Do} + C_{Di}) $$
