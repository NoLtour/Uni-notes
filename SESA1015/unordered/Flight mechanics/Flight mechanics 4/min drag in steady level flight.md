#### What is
## Min drag in steady level flight
Using the equations from [[calculating minimum drag]]:

> $$D_{min} = 2\sqrt{A'B'}$$ 
>> where:
>> $D_{min}=$  Minimum drag
>> $A'=$ constant
>> $B'=$ constant

Subbing in for A n B:
$$\begin{align*}
D_{min} &=  2\sqrt{   \frac{ \rho S C_{Do}2 K W^{2} }{2\pi A\rho S}  }  \\
&= 2\sqrt{  C_{Do}W^{2} \cdot \frac{  K  }{\pi A}  }\\
&= 2W \sqrt{  C_{Do} \cdot \frac{ K  }{\pi A}  }
\end{align*}$$ 

> $$D_{min} = 2W \sqrt{  C_{Do} \cdot \frac{ K  }{\pi A}  } $$

### Implications

So we can see that minimum drag is directly linked to weight, hence why we need to reduce weight as much as possible for aircraft.
This also shows that minimum drag is independent of density, which can be seen on the following graph:

(this is lots of maths so lets [[lmao just shitposting|look at important work]])
