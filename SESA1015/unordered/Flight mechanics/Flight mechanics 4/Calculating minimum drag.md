#### How do you go about
## Calculating minimum drag
#### Conditions
First lets assume we are in steady flight at a constant altitude.

So:
$L=W$
$T=D$
$M_{CG}=0$
(because equilibrium)

#### Equations used

We know:
![[Lift equation#^1f2714]]
is the lift equation, so $L = W = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_L$

So given we are in steady flight at a constant altitude, the only thing that determins lift is V.

Also since $C_L$ [[Effect of angle on lift coefficient| is largely effected by ]]$\alpha$ we can assume that the angle of attack is constant
