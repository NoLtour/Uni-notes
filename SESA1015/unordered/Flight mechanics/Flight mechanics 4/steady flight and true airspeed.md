#### How can you express $C_L$ interms of true speed under
## Steady flight and true airspeed
#### Conditions
First lets assume we are in steady flight at a constant altitude.

So:
$L=W$
$T=D$
$M_{CG}=0$
(because equilibrium)

#### Calculations

We know:
![[Lift equation#^1f2714]]
is the lift equation, so $L = W = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_L$

So given we are in steady flight at a constant altitude, the only thing that determins lift is V.

Also since $C_L$ [[Effect of angle on lift coefficient| is largely effected by ]]$\alpha$ we can assume that the angle of attack is constant.
Using the lift equation and rearranging to get V as the subject:

$$ \sqrt \frac{2W}{\rho S C_L} = V $$ ^9455eb

Simplify further using [[wing loading#^39f294]] remembering $L=W$:

$$ \sqrt \frac{2w}{\rho C_L} = V $$ ^34c139
