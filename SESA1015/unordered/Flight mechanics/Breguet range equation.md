#### What is the
## Breguet range equation
### Equation
It is an equation that can be used to find the total ange of an aircraft.

> ### $$R = \frac{1}{s} \frac{VL}{D} \ln\left(1+\frac{W_f}{W_s}\right)$$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ range
>> $V=$ [[True airspeed]]
>> $s=$ [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]]
>> $\frac{L}{D}=$ [[lift to drag ratio]]
>> $W_f=$ starting fuel weight
>> $W_s=$ dry aircraft weight

^20c05c

#### Assumptions
It assumes that the cruise is preformed at a constant $\frac{VL}{Ds}$

### Implications
This tells us what is needed to maxamise the range fuel efficiency of an aircraft:
- Low $s$, the engines need to be as efficient as possible
- Maximum $\frac{VL}{D}$, good aerodynamics
- Maximum $W_f/W_s$, good structural design to minamise dry weight
