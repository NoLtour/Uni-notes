#### What is the
## Breguet range equation
### Equation
It is an equation that can be used to find the total ange of an aircraft.

> ### $$R = \frac{V}{s} \frac{L}{D} \ln\left(1+\frac{W_f}{W_s}\right)$$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ range
>> $V=$ [[True airspeed]]
>> $s=$ [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]]
>> $\frac{L}{D}=$ [[lift to drag ratio]]
>> $W_f=$ starting fuel weight
>> $W_s=$ dry aircraft weight

#### Assumptions
It assumes that the cruise is preformed at a constant $\frac{VL}{Ds}$

### Implications
This tells us what is needed to maxamise the range fuel efficiency
