#### How can you get
## The rate at which aircraft weight decreases
### Introduction
Unless you are drone striking an orphanage the only reason your plane should really be loosing weight is through fuel consumption, and here's a real shocker fuel consumption is determined by... engines. (atleast I hope so)

So we need a nice way of expressing fuel consumption interms of thrust, to do this we use [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)]].

![[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)]]

### Implications when in equalibrium

Well we know that:
- Thrust = Drag
- Lift = Weight

So lets sub that into out [[specific fuel consumption (aircraft)|s.f.c]] equation.

    &= <% tp.file.cursor(1) %>
\end{align*}$$
