## Comparing maximum range and maximum endurance
#### [[endurance equation|Endurance equation]] (max time for fuel)
![[endurance equation#^76741c]]

#### [[Breguet range equation]] (max distance for fuel)
![[Breguet range equation#^20c05c]]

### Comparison

Although very simular there is a key difference in how speed effects the equation:
- Maximum endurance requires maximum constant $L/D$
- Maximum range requires maximum constant $VL/D$

This means choosing between maximising range or maxamising endur
