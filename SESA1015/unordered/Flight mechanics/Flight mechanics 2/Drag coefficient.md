#### How could you find the
## Drag coefficient

Can be found using:

> $$ C_D = C_{Do} + C_{Di} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_D =$ [[Drag coefficient]]
>> $C_{Do} =$ [[profile drag coefficient]]
>> $C_{Di} =$ [[induced drag coefficient]]

Further if we use the equations for calculating the [[induced drag coefficient]] we can get:

> $$ C_D = C_{Do} + \dfrac{K(C_L)^{2}}{\pi A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_D =$ [[Drag coefficient]]
>> $C_{Do} =$ [[profile drag coefficient]]
>> $C_L=$ [[Lift coefficient]]
>> $K =$ constant (see [[induced drag coefficient#^fce277]])
>> $A =$ [[Wing aspect ratio]]

It is

Typical values for this equation give you:
$$C_D = 0.02 + 0.055(C_L)^2$$
