#### How could you find the
## Drag coefficient

Can be found using:

> $$ C_D = C_{Do} + C_{Di} $$ 
>> where:
>> $C_D =$ [[Drag coefficient]]
>> $C_{Do} =$ [[profile drag coefficient]]
>> $C_{Di} =$ [[induced drag coefficient]]

Further if we use the equations for calculating the [[profile drag coefficient]]
