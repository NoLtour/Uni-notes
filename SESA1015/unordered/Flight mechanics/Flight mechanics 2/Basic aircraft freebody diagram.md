#### Sketch a labled 
## Basic aircraft freebody diagram
![[Pasted image 20211020145827.png]]

Here:
$R =$ [[Aerodynamic Reaction]]
$V =$ [[Relative wind]]
$CG =$ Centre of gravity (note this is important for [[Flight path]])
$\alpha =$ [[Angle of attack]]

(also note that [[typical length]] ($l$) may be included in the diagram as well)

In summary, the forces acting on the plane are:

| Symbol | Force  | Direction | unit |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | ---- |
| $L$    | Lift   | upwards   | $N$  |
| $D$    | Drag   | backwards | $N$  |
| $M$    | Moment | nose up   | $Nm$ |
