#### What is
## Equivalent Airspeed

It is defined as the speed at sea level (using the [[International Standard Atmosphere]]) that would produce the same incompressible [[dynamic pressure]] as the [[True airspeed]] at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying.

> $$ \text{Equivalent Airspeed} = \text{True Airspeed} * \sqrt{\text{Relative Density}} $$

Alternatively (the better format subbing in for [[relative density (planes)]]):

> $$ V_E \cdot \sqrt{ \rho_0 }= V \cdot \sqrt{ \rho } $$

>> $V_E=$ [[Equivalent Airspeed]]
>> $V=$ [[True airspeed]]
>> $\rho_0=$ Air density at sea level
>> $\rho=$ Local air density
