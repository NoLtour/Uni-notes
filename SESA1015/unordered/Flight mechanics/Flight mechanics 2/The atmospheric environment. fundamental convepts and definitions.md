# The atmospheric environment. fundamental convepts and definitions

![[International Standard Atmosphere]]

### Measuring air speed
![[Calculateing airspeed with a pitot tube]]

### Mach number
As an aircraft approachest the [[Speed of sound]] the mach number becomes important. (Note [[Calculating the speed of sound]])

![[Mach number]]

### Diagrams, forces and lift

You should be able to identitfy the names of all the forces acting on a basic plane diagram:
![[Basic aircraft freebody diagram]]

The lift can then be determined using:
![[Lift equation]]

Simularly:
![[Drag equation]]

And finally:
![[Pitching moment equation]]
