#### How would you go about
## Calculateing airspeed with a pitot tube

$\Delta h$ can be used to determin the pressure difference between $p$ and $p_0$.

Using [[Bernouillis Equation]] we know the difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is:

$$ p_0 - p = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 $$
