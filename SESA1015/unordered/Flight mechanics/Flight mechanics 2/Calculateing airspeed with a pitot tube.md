#### How would you go about
## Calculateing airspeed with a pitot tube

$\Delta h$ can be used to determin the pressure difference between $p$ and $p_0$.

Using [[Bernouillis Equation]] we know the difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is:

$$ p_0 - p = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 $$

If the two sides of the [[pitot-static tube|pitot tube]] are connected to a differential pressure guage we can get a value for $p_0-p$ and hence for $\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2$ (this value is called the [[dynamic pressure]]).

Hence true airspeed can be found by rearranging the previous equation to:

$$ V = \sqrt{} $$
