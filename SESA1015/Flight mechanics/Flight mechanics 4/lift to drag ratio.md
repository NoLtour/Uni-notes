#### What is a
## Lift to drag ratio
This is the ratio between a objects [[lift equation|lift]] and [[Drag equation|drag]]:

$L = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_L$

$D = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_D$

As you can see $L/D$ will cancel everything out so lift to drag ratio:

> $$ (L/D) = \frac{L}{D} = \frac{C_L}{C_D} $$ 
>> where:
>> $L/D=$ LD ratio 
>> $C_D=$ [[Drag coefficient]]
>> $C_L=$ [[Lift coefficient]]

> $$ (L / D) = \frac{C_L}{C_{Do} + \dfrac{K(C_L)^{2}}{\pi A}}= \frac{\pi A C_{L}}{\pi A C_{Do} + K(C_L)^{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $L/D=$ LD ratio 
>> $C_{Do} =$ [[profile drag coefficient]]
>> $C_L=$ [[Lift coefficient]]
>> $K =$ constant (see [[induced drag coefficient#^fce277]])
>> $A =$ [[Wing aspect ratio]]

Typical values for L/D ratio are ~8, 10 being quite good
