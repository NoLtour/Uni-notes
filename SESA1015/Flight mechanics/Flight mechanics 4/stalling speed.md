#### What is
## Stalling speed
### Description and calcualation
This is the minimum speed at which the aricraft can fly (before stalling and dropping out the fucking sky, hence really important).
It occurs when the [[Lift coefficient]] reaches it's maximum ($C_L = C_{Lmax}$), you can express stalling speed by subbing into the equation from [[steady flight and true airspeed#^34c139]].

> $$  V_S =  \sqrt \frac{2w}{\rho C_{Lmax}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $V_S=$ Stalling speed
>> $C_{Lmax}=$ max $C_L$
>> $\rho=$ air density
>> $w=$ [[wing loading]]

It should be noted that with a constant wing loading and max lift coefficient, the true air speed at the stall increases as the air density decreases (at higher altitudes you go faster).
It should also be noted that the [[Equivalent Airspeed#^cb174e]] at stall remains constant with altitude $V_E^{2} * \rho_0 = V^{2} * \rho$ subbing in: $V_E^{2}* \rho_0 =  \dfrac{2w}{\rho C_{Lmax}} * \rho = \dfrac{2w}{C_{Lmax}}$, hence constant.

### Changing it
Just like [[Lift coefficient]], $C_{Lmax}$ is effected by the aircrafts configuration, which is a key reason why aircrafts have [[flaps]] and [[slats]]; during clean flight $C_{Lmax} \approx 1.2$, but during take off and landing we want as small a stalling speed as possible, so we change the aircraft configuration to increase $C_{Lmax}$ so our stalling speed decreases allowing for the slow speeds not to cause our aircraft to (fucking) crash ([[which shockingly is usually the main idea]]).

### Finding the alternative form

$$\begin{align*}
V_S &=  \sqrt \frac{2w}{\rho C_{Lmax}} & w = \frac{L}{S} \\
&=  \sqrt \frac{2w}{\rho C_{Lmax}}
\end{align*}$$
