#### Whats the method for
## Maximising the breguet range
### Introduction
We know that the [[Breguet range equation]] allows us to calculate aircraft range, but we can use maths to find how to get a maximum value for a given fuel load.

### Math time
![[Breguet range equation#^20c05c]]



$R = \frac{1}{s} \frac{VL}{D} \ln\left(1+\frac{W_f}{W_s}\right)$
