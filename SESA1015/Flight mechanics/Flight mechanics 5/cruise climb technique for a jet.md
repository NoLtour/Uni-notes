#### What is
## Cruise climb technique for a jet
#### Introduction
So we already know [[cruise pattern|the problem]] that [[cruise pattern|cruise climb technique]] is trying to solve.

So using the [[lift equation]] we know: $L=\frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}SC_L$

To keep lift equal to weight as the fuel is burned we therefore must change one of the following:
- $\rho$
- $V$
- $C_L$

The technique we are focusing on here is going to assume that true airspeed and angle of attack are constant [[Effect of angle on lift coefficient|(because lift coefficient's a function of angle of attack)]].

#### Math
If $C_L$ is constant then:
$$\begin{align*}
   \frac{L}{D} &= \frac{C_L}{D_D}\\
&= \frac{C_L}{C} 
\end{align*}$$
