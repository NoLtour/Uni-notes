#### What is the
## Constant altitude and angle of attack [[cruise pattern]] (jet)
Unlike the [[cruise climb with constant speed|the other technique]] we encountered this one involves varying the speed and maintaining the same altitude.

### Assumptions
The angle of attack is constant and the altitude is constant:
- $L/D=$ constant (angle of attack is constant)
- $\rho=$ constant (altitude is constant)

Hence since:
$$\begin{align*}
  W = L &= \frac{1}{2}\rho V^{2}S C_L
\end{align*}$$
We must be varying the speed to control lift as weight changes, so $V=\sqrt\frac{2W}{\rho S C_L}$
