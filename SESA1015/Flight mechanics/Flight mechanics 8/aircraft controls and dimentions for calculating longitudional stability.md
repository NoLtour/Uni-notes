#### What are the
## Aircraft controls and dimentions for calculating longitudional stability
### Intro
Control is defined as the ability to change from one flight condition to another, and to be able to correct for the effect of disturbances.

In reality there are 6 degrees of freedom (x,y,z motion and roll,pitch,yaw) but here we will focus on those relevant for pitch.

### Dimentions
This diagram shows all the measurements we will be using and their corresponding symbols. Note that these measurements are being taken relative to a [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]].

We are also going to assume that thrust and drag act through the centre of gravity so that we don't need to account for them.

>> where:
>> $L_W=$ Total lift of aircraft, excluding tailplane
>> $P=$ Lift of tailplane (horizontal stabiliser) alone
>> $M_0=$ Pitching moment at zero lift
>> $W=$ aircraft weight
>> $c=$ Refrence wing [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]] (chord selected can vary so note what's being used)
>> $hc - h_0 c=$ Distance between [[aerodynamic centre]] and centre of gravity
>> $h=$ fraction of the wing chord from the leading edge to aerodynamic centre ($h=$)
