#### What are the
## Aircraft controls and dimentions for calculating longitudional stability
### Intro
Control is defined as the ability to change from one flight condition to another, and to be able to correct for the effect of disturbances.

In reality there are 6 degrees of freedom (x,y,z motion and roll,pitch,yaw) but here we will focus on those relevant for pitch.

### Dimentions
This diagram shows all the measurements we will be using and their corresponding symbols. Note that these measurements are being taken relative to a [[chord (aeronautics)|chord]].
