#### Describe and explain
## Logitudional static stability
### Intro

This is where you get [[static stability]] in the pitch axis of the aircraft, expressed mathamatically:

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dC_{mG}}{d\alpha} &< 0 
\end{align*}$$
$dC_{mG}$ being the pitching moment about the centre of gravity
$\alpha$ being the [[Angle of attack]]
