#### How do you determine the
## Tailplane lift coefficient
### Intro
The tailplane is kinda annoying, because when positioned behined the main wing it ends up recieving the main wings downwash. So the air comes at it with an akward angle, which we need to account for.

Note that:
$\alpha_s=$ rigging angle of tailplane relative to the body datum
$\eta=$ elevator angle
