#### What is the
## Breguet range equation (piston engine)
Not this is different to the [[Breguet range equation (jets)]]
> ### $$ R = \frac{\eta}{s'}\frac{L}{D}\cdot \ln\left( \frac{W_1}{W_2} \right) $$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ Range 
>> $\eta=$ [[propeller combined efficiency]]
>> $s'=$ [[fuel consumption of a piston engined aircraft|specific fuel consumption (engine)]]
>> $\frac{L}{D}=$ [[lift to drag ratio]]
>> $W_1=$ Starting weight
>> $W_2=$ Final weight
