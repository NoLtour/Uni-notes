#### Whats the method for
## Maxamising range for a piston engined aircraft
Starting with:
![[Breguet range equation (piston engine)]]

We can see everything is going to be constant except lift to drag ratio, so depending on it's value our range will change.

#### Maxamising lift to drag
We already did this (pog): 
![[max lift to drag ratio#^570509]]

So:
$$\begin{align*}
   R =& \frac{\eta}{s'}\frac{L}{D}\cdot \ln\left( \frac{W_1}{W_2} \right)  & (L/D)_{max} &= \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{  \frac{1}{C_{Do}} \cdot \frac{ \pi A }{K }  }\\
R_{max} =& \frac{\eta}{s'}\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{  \frac{1}{C_{Do}} \cdot \frac{ \pi A }{K }  }\cdot \ln\left( \frac{W_1}{W_2} \right)
\end{align*}$$
