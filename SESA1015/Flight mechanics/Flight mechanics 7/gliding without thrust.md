#### What are the equations for
## Gliding without thrust

![[Pasted image 20211123174004.png]]

$$\begin{align*}
   & & L &= W \cos \theta & D = W\sin\theta\\
\frac{D}{L} &= \frac{W\sin\theta}{W \cos \theta}\\
&= \tan \theta\\
\therefore \frac{D}{L}&\approx \theta \:\:\:small\:angle\:approx
\end{align*}$$

The glide angle will be a minimum when L/D ([[lift to drag ratio]]) is at a maximum. This will occur at [[calculating minimum drag|minimum drag]].

We know that [[calculating minimum drag|minimum drag]] occurs when [[induced drag coefficient]] = [[form drag]]
