ok you found it, now find the long rant about me hiding this meme somewhere.
By finding this meme and the rant you get the +3 \[\[KROMER\]\]
More if you know where the game is from

![[and_when_all_five_pieces_of_the_forbidden_cirno_are_all_at_play....mp4#play]]

Even more bonus points if you find the obamium meme that this meme is a evolution of.
