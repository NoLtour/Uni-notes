#### How do you find the
## Ratio of stalling speed for a co-ordinated turn
### Useful bit
> ### $$ \frac{V_{sr}}{V_s} = \sqrt n $$ 
>> where:
>> $V_{sr}=$ 
>> $V_s=$
>> $n=$


### Math
We can get the equation for [[stalling speed]] from well, that little link <--- (I hope you know that's a link, because if you only just realized that I have no clue what you have been doing with these notes. {more importantly it would mean you have missed 99% of my [[memes]]} )

$$\begin{align*}
 &= 
\end{align*}$$
