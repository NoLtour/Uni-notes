#### Whats the equation for
## Calculating lift in a co-ordinated turn
This equation defines the lift an aircraft requires to maintain equalibrium when in a [[co-ordinated turn]].

> ### $$ L = W \sqrt{ 1 + \left(\frac{V^{2}}{gR}\right)^{2} } $$ 
>> where:
>> $L=$ Lift
>> $W=$ Weight
>> $V=$ Airspeed
>> $g=$ Gravity
>> $R=$ Radius of turning circle
