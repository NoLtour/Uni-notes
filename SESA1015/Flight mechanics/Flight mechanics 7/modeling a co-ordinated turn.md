#### Whats the method for
## Modeling a [[co-ordinated turn]]

We will be using the following diagram when doing maths.

We will use $\phi$ for [[bank angle]].
We also know the [[centrifugal force equation]] is $F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$

We know that the aircraft is in equilibrium:

> Vertacle equilibrium
> $$\begin{align*}
L\cos(\phi)&=W 
\end{align*}$$

> Horizontal equilibrium
> $$\begin{align*}
L\sin(\phi) &= \frac{mV^{2}}{R}\\
&= \frac{W}{g}\frac{V^{2}}{R}
\end{align*}$$

> Longitudinal equilibrium
> $$\begin{align*}
T    &= D
\end{align*}$$

Knowing this we can combine them to:
$$\begin{align*}
    &= 
\end{align*}$$
