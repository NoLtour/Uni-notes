#### Whats the method for
## Modeling a [[co-ordinated turn]]

We will be using the following diagram when doing maths.

We will use $\phi$ for [[bank angle]].
We also know the [[centrifugal force equation]] is $F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}$

We know that the aircraft is in equalibrium:

> Verticle equalibrium
> $$\begin{align*}
L\cos(\phi)&=W 
\end{align*}$$

> Horizontal equalibrium
> $$\begin{align*}
L\cos(\phi)    &= 
\end{align*}$$
