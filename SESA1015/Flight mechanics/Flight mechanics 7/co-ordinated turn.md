#### What is a
## Co-ordinated turn
In order to change the direction of flight the aircraft must be able to carry out turning manoeuvres. 
When in steady level flight, the aircraft can be manoeuvred into turning flight by:
- deflecting the ailerons alone
- using the rudder alone
-  a combination of ailerons and the rudder. If ailerons 
alone are used the aircraft always has an angle of "sideslip" - this increases the drag compared with the 
no-sideslip case. In the case of a rudder only turn, the rudder deflection induces an angle of roll which 
inclines the lift vector and causes the flight path to be curved. In the rudder only turn the relative wind 
approaches the aircraft from outside the turn and the aircraft is said to be "skidding". If the rudder and 
ailerons are used together, turning flight can be achieved in which the aircraft is always aligned with 
the relative wind and this turn is called a co-ordinated turn. In the analysis which follows a co-
ordinated turn in the horizontal plane will be considered.
