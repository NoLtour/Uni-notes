#### What is the
## Limit on the load factor during a co-ordinated turn

The [[load factor]] is essentially the g's that the aircraft is pullin, so if it gets two high your wings will fall off (or well something will break) because you are applying large forces on all parts of the plane so you hit limits that come from the [[yield strength|strength]] of the materail.

Shockingly if your wings fall off the plane dosn't like that, unless your the (insert some experimental plane that did that).
