#### How can you find
## Minimum rate of descent

We know $- \frac{dh}{dt} = V \frac{D}{W}$ from [[gliding without thrust]], so to minamise the rate of descent we need to find where VD is at a minimum (W can be approximated as constant since not only is this a small duration but thrust is zero).

Luckily we already know that to get VD at a minimum we can use the [[minimum power speed]].

Now we can also get the [[minimum power speed#Lift to drag ratio]]

$$\begin{align*}
   \theta &= \frac{1}{\left(\frac{L}{D}_{minP}\right)} & \frac{L}{D}_{minP} &= \frac{1}{4} \sqrt\frac{3}{k C_{Do}  } \\
 &=  4 \sqrt\frac{k C_{Do}}{ 3 }
\end{align*}$$
