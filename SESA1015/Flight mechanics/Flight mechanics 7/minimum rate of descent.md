#### How can you find
## Minimum rate of descent

We know $- \frac{dh}{dt} = V \frac{D}{W}$ from [[gliding without thrust]], so to minamise the rate of descent we need to find where VD is at a minimum (W can be approximated as constant since not only is this a small duration but thrust is zero).

Luckily we already know that to get VD at a minimum is the [[minimum power speed]] from the relationship:
