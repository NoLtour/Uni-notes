## Calculating limits on preformance for a co-ordinated turn

We have this useful boi that we calculated previously:
![[calculating lift in a co-ordinated turn#^6e5848]]

We know each of these values have limitations, things like max lift coefficient, [[stalling speed]], even [[yield strength|yield stress]] and limitations on the forces the aircraft can experience. So lets rearrange our lift equation to fas
