#### What is the
## Minimum radius of turning during a co-ordinated turn

We know:
$$ R = \frac{V^{2}}{g\sqrt{\frac{L^{2}}{W^{2}} - 1}} = \frac{V^{2}}{g\sqrt{ n^{2} - 1}} $$

So if we want to find the minimum radius that the aircraft can turn, we need to get:
- Lift to a maximum
- [[load factor]] to a maximum
- [[bank angle]] to a maximum
