#### What is the
## Minimum radius of turning during a co-ordinated turn
### Min radius equation
> ### $$R_{min} = \frac{V^{2}}{g} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n^{2}_{min}-1}}$$ 
>> where:
>> $R_{min}=$ 
>> $V=$
>> $g=$

### Meth time
We know:
$$ R = \frac{V^{2}}{g\sqrt{\frac{L^{2}}{W^{2}} - 1}} = \frac{V^{2}}{g\sqrt{ n^{2} - 1}} $$

So if we want to find the minimum radius that the aircraft can turn, we need to get:
- Lift to a maximum
- [[load factor]] to a maximum
- [[bank angle]] to a maximum
- g to a somet. Yes what I'm saying is to control gravity. COPE

#### Maeth time (special edition)
It's litterally just subbing in, no rearranging:
$$\begin{align*}
   R_{min} &= \frac{V^{2}}{g} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n^{2}_{min}-1}}
\end{align*}$$
