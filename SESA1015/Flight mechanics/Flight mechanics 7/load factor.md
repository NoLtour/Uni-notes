#### What is
## Load factor ($n$)
The load factor is the ratio of the lift of an aircraft to its weight and represents a global measure of the stress ("load") to which the structure of the aircraft is subjected.

> ### $$ n = \frac{L}{W} $$ 
> ### $$ \sqrt n = \frac{V_{Sr}}{V_S} $$ 
>> where:
>> $n=$ [[load factor]]
>> $L=$ Lift
>> $W=$ Weight
>> $V_{Sr}=$ [[stalling speed]] during a [[co-ordinated turn]]
>> $V_S=$ [[stalling speed]] during steady level flight

In a [[co-ordinated turn]] the resaulting vector of the weight and centrafugal forces act "down" relative to the passengers. 
Basically when someone says "I'm experiencing 69g's" then $n=69$, and I'm not sure how they survived pulling 69 fucking g's, like fuck they must be a pancake, and a somehow sentient pancake at that?
