#### Whats the method for
## Calculating the speed of sound
> $$ a=\sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma p}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\gamma RT} $$ 
>> where:
>> $a =$ [[speed of sound]]
>> $R =$ gas constant
>> $T =$ temperature
>> $\rho =$ density
>> $p =$ pressure??????? <- check
>> $\gamma=$ ratio of [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]]s for the gas

In the atmosphere it can be taken as the following:

> ### $$ a = \sqrt{ 400.4 \cdot T } $$ 
>> where:
>> $\gamma=$ 1.4
>> $R=$ 286
>> $T=$ temperature
