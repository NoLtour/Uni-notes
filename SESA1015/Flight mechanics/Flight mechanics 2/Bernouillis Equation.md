#### What is the
## Bernouillis Equation
This is simplified and ignores GPE (but that's not important for our usecase so can be ignored)
> $$ p_0 = p + \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 $$ 
>> where:
>> $p_0 =$ stagnation pressure
>> $p =$ static pressure
>> $V =$ velocity of flow ($m/s$)
>> $\rho =$ density

It assumes that:
* Fluid is incompressible
* No work is done by the fluid
* No heat transfer into the fluid

Basically it is the [[cope seeth mald no bitches ratio L ect|shit]] form of [[conservation of energy flow#^4479a0|conservation of energy in flow equation]] where you have [[skill issue]] because there is no change in GPE.
