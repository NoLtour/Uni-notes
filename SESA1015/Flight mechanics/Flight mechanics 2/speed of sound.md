#### What is the
## Speed of sound
The speed of sound is a measure of the speed of propagation of weak pressure waves in the air (a compressable medium).
Generally the speed of sound is denoted by $a$. 

It has a relationship with current speed according to [[Mach number]].

In air (treating as an [[ideal gas law|ideal gas]]) it is given by:
> ### $$ c = \sqrt{ \gamma \cdot \frac{p}{\rho} } $$ 
>> where:
>> $c=$ [[speed of sound]] 
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $\rho=$ air density
>> $P=$ air pressure
