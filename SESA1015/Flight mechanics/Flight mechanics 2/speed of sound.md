#### What is the
## Speed of sound
The speed of sound is a measure of the speed of propagation of weak pressure waves in the air (a compressable medium).
Generally the speed of sound is denoted by $a$. 

It has a relationship with current speed according to [[Mach number]].

### Equations (in air as an ideal gas)

In air (treating as an [[ideal gas law|ideal gas]]) it is given by:
> ### $$ c = \sqrt{ \gamma RT } = \sqrt{ \gamma RT_{0} \theta } $$ 
>> where:
>> $c=$ [[speed of sound]] 
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>> $T=$ absolute temperature
>> Note that sometimes temperature is given as $\theta$ which is some fraction of $T_{0}$, where $T_{0}$ is air temp as sea level:
>> $T=T_{0} \times \theta$

> ### $$ c = \sqrt{ \gamma \cdot \frac{p}{\rho} } $$ 
>> where:
>> $c=$ [[speed of sound]] 
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $\rho=$ air density
>> $P=$ air pressure

> ### $$ c = \sqrt{ \gamma \frac{R}{M_{air}} T } = \sqrt{ \gamma \frac{R}{M_{air}} (\theta+273.15) } $$ 
>> where:
>> $R=8.314462\:J/(mol\cdot K)$
>> $M_{air}=0.028964\:kg/mol=$ molar gas constant of air
>> $\frac{R}{M_{air}}=287.062$
>> $c=$ [[speed of sound]] in air
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $T=$ Temperature in kelvin
>> $\theta=$ Temp in Celsius
