#### What is the
## Isentropic expansion factor ($\gamma$)
It is the ratio of the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of a gas at constant pressure to that of a gas at constant volume $(C_{p}/C_{v})$:

> ### $$ \gamma = \frac{C_{p}}{C_{v}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $C_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]]
>> $C_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
