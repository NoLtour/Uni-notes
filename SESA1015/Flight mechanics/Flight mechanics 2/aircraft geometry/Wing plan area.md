#### What's an aircraft's
## Wing plan area ($S$)
This is basically just top down 2D representation of a wings area, the complication comes in when you try to define "wing". Generally there are the following 2 definitions:

> ### $$ S = b\bar{c} = \frac{b^{2}}{A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $S=$ Wing plan area 
>> $b=$ [[Wing span]]
>> $A=$ [[Wing aspect ratio]]
>> $\bar{c}=$ [[Mean chord|Mean aerodynamic chord]]
