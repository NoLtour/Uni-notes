## Derivative of a parametric curve

This is really really easy, take the equation of the [[formal definition of a parametric curve|parametric curve]] and litterally just derive each bit:

> ### $$\begin{align*}  \vec{r}(t) &=  f(t)\hat{i} + g(t)\hat{j} & &a\leq t \leq b \end{align*}$$ 
> ### $$\begin{align*}  \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} &=  \frac{df}{dt}\hat{i} + \frac{dg}{dt}\hat{j} \end{align*}$$ 
>> where:
>> $\vec{r}(t)=$ the function of the curve 
>> $t=$ called the "parameter", it's some arbitrary position along the curve, in range $a\to b$ usually the range will be $0\to1$
>> $\hat{i},\hat{j}=$ unit vectors of axis

If you've used your brain slightly, then you've also realised that this is equivilent to the tangent of a parametric curve.
