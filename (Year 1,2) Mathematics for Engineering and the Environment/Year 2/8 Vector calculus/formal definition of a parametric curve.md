## Formal definition of a parametric curve

Mathematically, a parametric curve $C$ in the plane consists of an ordered pair $(f , g)$ of continuous functions (one for each axis) each defined on the same interval $a\leq t \leq b$ eg in this 2D case:
$$\begin{align*}
C:& \begin{dcases} x=f(t) \\ y=g(t) \end{dcases} & &a\leq t \leq b
\end{align*}$$
I think this is a stupid way of describing it tbh, so lets put it in understandable speak: you define the curve as a function constructed from a set of continuous functions for each axis in terms of some arbitrary variable such as $t$:
> ### $$\begin{align*}  \vec{r}(t) &=  f(t)\hat{i} + g(t)\hat{j} & &a\leq t \leq b \end{align*}$$ 
>> where:
>> $\vec{r}(t)=$ the function of the curve 
>> $t=$ called the "parameter", it's some arbitrary position along the curve, in range $a\to b$ usually the range will be $0\to1$
>> $\hat{i},\hat{j}=$ unit vectors of axis
