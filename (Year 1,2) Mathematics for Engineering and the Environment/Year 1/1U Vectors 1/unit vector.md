#### What is a
## Unit vector
This is a vector divided by it's magnitude, basically a vector that is used only for direction (magnitude 1).

Also the name for the sign used is "hat", so this is "$\underline{a}$ hat" $=\hat{\underline{a}}$ [[I dont know why I find this funny but I do|kek]].

> ### $$ \hat{\underline{a}} = \frac{\underline{a}}{|\underline{a}|} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\hat{\underline{a}}=$ [[unit vector]] of $\underline{a}$ 
>> $\underline{a}=$ some [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
