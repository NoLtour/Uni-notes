#### What is the mathematical method for
## Finding optimal values
This is pretty simple, if you want to find the value for which some function is at a maximum or minimum then you can differentiate it and equate to to zero, all maximums and minimums occur where rate of change is zero:

That being said you can also find inflection points where rate of change is zero, so being able to identify the nature of these points is important. This leads onto the next point, by differentiating a second time you can identify the nature of a point.

>> where:
>> $f^{'}(X)=0$ a stationary point
>> $f(x)=$ some function of x

Note that when $f^{'}(X)=0$ we call that a stationary point
