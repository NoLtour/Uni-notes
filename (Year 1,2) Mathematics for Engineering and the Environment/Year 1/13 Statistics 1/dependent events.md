#### Describe
## Dependent events
These are events that arn't [[independent events]] (real shocker), this is where the outcome of one event has an effect on the outcome of the other. Expressed mathamatically is:
> ### $$ P(A \cap B) \neq P(A) \times P(B) $$
> ### $$ P(A|B) \neq P(A) $$
> ### $$ P(B|A) \neq P(B) $$
>> where:
>> $A,B=$ dependent events
>> Used [[conditional probablility]]
