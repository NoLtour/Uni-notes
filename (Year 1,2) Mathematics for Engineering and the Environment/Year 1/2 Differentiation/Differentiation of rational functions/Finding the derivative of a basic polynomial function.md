## Finding the derivative of a basic polynomial function

Using the method of [[Derivative of simple exponent]] on the following function with refrence to [[Basic rules of differentiation]] you can easily differentiate the following:

$$ f(x) = a_0 + a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3....+a_{n-1}x^{n-1} = \sum^n_{r=0}a_rx^r $$

$$ into $$

$$ \dot{f}(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x+3a_3x^2+....+(n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} = \sum^n_{r=0}ra_rx^{r-1} $$
