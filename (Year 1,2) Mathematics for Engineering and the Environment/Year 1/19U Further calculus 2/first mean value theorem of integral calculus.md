#### What is the
## First mean value theorem of integral calculus
Basically what this equation is stating is that some value of $x$ exists ($c$) where the function $f$ is equal to the [[mean value by integration|mean value]] between $a$ and $b$, which is true for all continuous graphs.

> ### $$ f(c) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int^{b}_{a} f(x) \cdot dx $$ 
> ### $$ f(c)\times(b-a) = \int^{b}_{a} f(x) \cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $[a,b]=$ the [[domain (functions)|domain]] over which the function is continuous 
>> $a<c<b$
>> $f=$ some function

It can be rearranged to get the [[first mean value theorem of differential calculus]].
