#### What is a
## Power series
### Definition
Any series in the following format:

> ### $$ a_{0} + a_{1} x + a_{2} x^{2} + a_{3} x^{3} + .... + a_{n} x^{n} + ... $$ 
>> where:
>> $a_{i}=$ are independent of $x$

So the [[Maclaurin series#^2648d4|Maclaurin series]] can be described as a [[power series]].

### Convergence and divergence
All power series will converge for certain values of x and diverge for others, for example it's common for $|x|<1$ to converge towards a single value as the number of terms in the series increases.

A effective test for convergence is using [[Alemberts ratio test]] where:
> #### Convergent series
> ### $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \left| \frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1} } \right|  > |x| $$ 
> #### Divergent series
> ### $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \left| \frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1} } \right|  \leq |x| $$ 
>> where:
>> $a_{i}=$ is a value independent of x in a [[power series]]
