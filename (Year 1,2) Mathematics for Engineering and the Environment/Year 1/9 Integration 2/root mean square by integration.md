#### How can we find the
## Root mean square by integration
Figure it out for yourself.

Or use this equation:

> ### $$ r.m.s = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{b-a} \int^{b}_a [f(x)]^{2} \cdot dx } $$ 
>> where:
>> $r.m.s=$ root mean square in range 
>> $a,b=$ range
>> $f(x)=$ continous function (within limits)

Remember since it squares the function this measures magnitude since negatives well.. [[more memememmeadjawfjawof|arn't]] anymore.
