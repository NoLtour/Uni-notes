#### How can we find
## [[I am sorry about this|Arc]]length and surface area using integration

To find surface area uses a simular technique to [[volume of a solid of revolution]], but if you want to proof look it up.

I only used the word [[and yes they do all suck|arc]] 3 times, well rip... I have way more than 3 memes but looks like I'll have to put them somewhere else.
