#### What are
## Consistant equations
These are the opposite of [[inconsistant equations]], this is when a set of linear equations have consistant solutions between them:
$$\begin{align*}
2x+y &= 1\\
x+y&=3\\\\
&& x&=-2 & y&=5 
\end{align*}$$
A set of equations without a specific solution can also be [[consistant equations]]:
$$\begin{align*}
x+y+z &= 69\\
y+4z&= 420 
\end{align*}$$
