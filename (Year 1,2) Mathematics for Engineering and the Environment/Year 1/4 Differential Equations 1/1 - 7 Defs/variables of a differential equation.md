#### What are the
## Variables of a differential equation
### Definition
[[differential equation|Differential equations]] have different variables, it is useful to know the terms for them.

For [[ordinary differential equation|ODE]]s you can describe variables as either:
- [[dependent variables]]
- [[independent variables]]

A more specific definition is used when talking about [[differentiation]]:
- [[independent variables]] - The variables with respect to which differentiation occurs
- [[dependent variables]] - those that are differentiated

### Example
In the following equation:
$$\begin{align*}
    \frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}} - 4x \frac{df}{dx} = \cos 2x
\end{align*}$$
- The independent variable is $x$.
- The dependent variable is $f$.
