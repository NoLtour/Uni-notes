## Effect of control surfaces on lift distrobution

![[Pasted image 20221222144539.png]]

It's kinda obvious, if you push out a flap then if fucks the lift distrobution and since generally planes are designed so that they follow an elliptic distrobution in normal flight the distrobution with flaps deployed will be non elliptic and hence much less efficient. 

Of course since $C_{L}$ increases the induced drag also increases for that reason.
