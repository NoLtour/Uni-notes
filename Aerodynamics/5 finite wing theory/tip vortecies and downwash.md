## Tip vortecies and downwash

We know that an airfoil produces lift due to the difference in pressure between the top and bottom, but consider this for a finite wing; at the tips there is no barrier preventing the high pressure to move over onto the low pressure side:

This is what causes the formation of tip vorticies:

These vortecies have an effect on the downwash along the wing:

Leading too the streamlines over the top and bottom being curved inwards and outwards which has a clear effect on the preformance of the foil:
