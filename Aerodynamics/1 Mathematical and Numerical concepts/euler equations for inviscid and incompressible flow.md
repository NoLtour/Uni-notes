## Euler equations for inviscid and incompressible flow

Basically we call these the Euler equations, (making this page for link purposes):

![[momentum balance in inviscid incompressible flow#^da19ae]]

![[mass continuity using divergence#^31084a]]

The first set deals with conservation of momentum in the x and y axis while the last one deals with conservation of mass.
