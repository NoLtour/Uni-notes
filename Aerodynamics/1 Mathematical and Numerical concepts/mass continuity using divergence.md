## Mass continuity using [[divergence operator|divergence]]

If we start by considering a [[control volume]], then we can calculate the rate of mass change in a control volume by finding:

$$ \sum\limits ( \text{ velocty in } \times \text{ density in } \times \text{area}) - \sum\limits ( \text{ velocty out } \times \text{ density out } \times \text{area}) =  $$

Here we are doing it over a 2D area:
