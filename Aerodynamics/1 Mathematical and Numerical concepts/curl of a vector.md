## Curl of a vector

This is a vector which measures the vorticity of a point, for a 2D flow it is:

> ### $$ 2D:\:\: \vec {\omega} = \nabla \times \vec{V} = \left(\frac{\delta V_{x}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta V_{y}}{\delta y} \right) \hat{e}_{z} $$  
>> where:
>> $\vec {\omega}=$ [[curl of a vector ]]
>> $\nabla=$ [[del operator]]
>> $\vec{V}=$ some vector
>> $\hat{e}_{z}=$ [[unit vector]] of $z$ direction (remember [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]] is represented in the vector normal to the plane of rotation, that's pretty much what's going on here)

We define
