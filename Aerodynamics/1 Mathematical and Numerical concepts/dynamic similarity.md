## Dynamic similarity
In fluid mechanics, dynamic similarity is the phenomenon that when there are two [[geometric similarity|geometrically similar]] vessels with the same boundary conditions (e.g., no-slip, center-line velocity) and the same [[reynolds number]] and Womersley numbers, then the fluid flows will be identical.
