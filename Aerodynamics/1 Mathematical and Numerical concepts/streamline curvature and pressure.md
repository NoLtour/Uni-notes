## Streamline curvature and pressure

If instead of using a Cartesian coordinate system we use one defined in terms of a streamline, where $s$ is tangent along the streamline and $n$ is normal to the streamline. Doing this [[momentum balance in inviscid incompressible flow#^da19ae|these equations]] become:

#### Equation along stream

> ### $$ \rho V_{s} \frac{\delta V_{s}}{\delta s} = - \frac{\delta p}{\delta s} $$ 
>> where:
>> $V_{s}=$ velocity tangent to streamline 
>> $s=$ position along streamline
>> $p=$ pressure

(Note that this equation actually integrates into the [[Bernouillis equation]], without accounting for height changes of course)
