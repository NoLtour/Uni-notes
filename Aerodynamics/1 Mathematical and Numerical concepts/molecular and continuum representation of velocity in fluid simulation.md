## Molecular and continuum representation of velocity in fluid simulation

### Molecular representation

In reality fluids are composed of many fast moving atoms, where their interactions with the environment/eachother determine the forces we observe:

This can be represented using [[ordinary differential equation]]s, such as:
$$ \vec{V_{i}} = \frac{d\vec{x_{i}}}{dt} $$
But of course representing each molecule with a velocity vector then crunching numbers to find useful results is practically impossible.


### Continuum representation
Since representing each molecules not really possible instead we
