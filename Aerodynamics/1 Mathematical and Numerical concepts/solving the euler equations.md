## Solving the [[euler equations for inviscid and incompressible flow|euler equations]]

These equations are still too complex to be solved analytically so we simplify them. (yes even further)

[[putting this away since I dont know why its needed|ignore]]

### Assuming irrotational flow

Start by assuming the flow is irrotational [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] is zero:

$$\begin{align*}
0&=\left(\frac{\delta V_{y}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta V_{x}}{\delta y} \right) \hat{e}_{z}\\
\frac{\delta V_{y}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta V_{x}}{\delta y
\end{align*}$$
