## Noteable properties of the del operator

#### Linearity

> ### $$ \nabla( \psi + \phi ) = \nabla \psi + \nabla \phi $$ 
>> where:
>> $\nabla=$ [[if you can not figure this out then get off the course|kinda obvious]]
>> $\psi,phi=$ arbitrary [[scalar fields]]

The proof is trivial so figure it out yourself.

#### Leibnitz rule

> ### $$ \nabla( \psi  \phi ) = \phi(\nabla \psi) + \psi(\nabla \phi) $$ 
>> where:
>> $\nabla=$ [[if you can not figure this out then get off the course|kinda obvious]]
>> $\psi,phi=$ arbitrary [[scalar fields]]

The proof is also ez, just use [[What's the product rule|product rule]].
