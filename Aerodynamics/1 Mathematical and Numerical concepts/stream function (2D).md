## Stream function (2D) ($\psi$)

Since no mass crosses a [[streamlines|streamline]], we can associate each streamline with a particular value of mass flow rate (or volume flow rate for constant density). This value is given the name, stream function (usually $\psi$).

The volume flow rate in between two streamlines can be found using the difference between their [[stream function (2D)|stream function]]s:
