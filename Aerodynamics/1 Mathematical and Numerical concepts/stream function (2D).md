## Stream function (2D) ($\psi$)

Since no mass crosses a [[streamlines|streamline]], we can associate each streamline with a particular value of mass flow rate (or volume flow rate for constant density). This value is given the name, stream function (usually $\psi$).

The volume flow rate in between two streamlines can be found using the difference between their [[stream function (2D)|stream function]]s:

> ### $$ \Delta \psi = Q\Delta n = V_{x} \Delta y - V_{y} \Delta x $$ 
> ### $$ V_{x} = \frac{\delta \psi}{ \delta y } $$
> ### $$ V_{y} = - \frac{\delta \psi}{ \delta x } $$

>> $Q=$ volume flow rate
>> $\psi=$ a stream function
>> $\Delta n=$ length of line between streamlines
>> $V_{x},V_{y}=$ velocity in x and y directions
