## Wall units

These are often used when [[approximating turbulent BL near the wall]]. When scaling wall normal quantities or velocities we refer to them this way, eg:

> ## $$ U^{+} = \frac{U}{U_{\tau}} $$ 
> ## $$ y^{+} = \frac{y}{l} = \frac{y U_{\tau}}{\nu} $$ 
>> where:
>> $U_{\tau}=$ [[approximating turbulent BL near the wall#^41fd5a|skin friction velocity]]
>> $\tau_{\omega}=$ [[local wall shear stress]] 
>> $\nu=$ [[kinematic viscosity]]
>> $l=$ [[approximating turbulent BL near the wall#^41fd5a|length scale for near wall velocity profile non dimensionalisation]]
