## Wall units

These are often used when [[approximating turbulent BL near the wall]]. When scaling wall normal quantities or velocities we refer to them this way, eg:

> ## $$ U^{+} = \frac{U}{U_{\tau}} $$ 
> ## $$ y^{+} = \frac{y}{l} = \frac{y U_{\tau}}{\nu} $$ 
>> where:
>> $U_{\tau}=$ velocity scale for near wall velocity profile non dimensionalisation (this specifically is known as [[approximating turbulent BL near the wall|skin friction velocity]])
>> $\tau_{\omega}=$ [[local wall shear stress]]
>> $\rho=$ fluid density
>> $\nu=$ [[kinematic viscosity]]
>> $l=$ length scale for near wall velocity profile non dimensionalisation
