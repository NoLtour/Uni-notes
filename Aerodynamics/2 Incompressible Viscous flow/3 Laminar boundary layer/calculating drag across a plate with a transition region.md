## Transition
We know from [[approximating a laminar BL profile]] and [[approximating a turbulent BL profile]] methods for modelling flow:

But the transition between the two cannot be as easily modelled, generally this transition region takes place somewhere between 300k to 1M [[Reynolds number]]. The question is how can we calculate drag while accounting for this region? The answer is that it is much easyer than you'd think.

We know that [[momentum thickness and viscous drag|momentum thickness is d]]
