## Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations

This is where we use a "statistical description of the flow". For turbulant flow we know of course they are [[unsteady flow]], the [[Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations|RANS]] approach is to convert velocity and pressures into their statistical representations, for example take the velocity of a point:

The velocity is
