## Modelling requirements for [[eddy (fluids)|eddy]] simulations

### Intro
It is of course possible to solve the [[navier stokes equations]] for any precision level using a big enough supercomputer ([[direct numerical simulation]]), but as discussed in [[turbulence at scale]] the complexity increases rapidly, hence we need to figure out how to simplify the equations such that the processing power required can be kept at a minimum while still producing adequate results.
