## Approximating turbulent BL near the wall

We've already discussed the problems with the [[approximating a turbulent BL profile#Issues with the approximation|previous approximation near the wall]], it's scale was adjusted using freestream to scale velocity and [[boundary layer thickness]] to scale distance; in the case of being near the wall the effect of [[viscosity]] and shear is clearly greatly increased, so it makes sense to somehow use that as a part of the non dimensionalisation near the wall.

By using [[buckingham pi]] to try to find something that makes sense as a velocity scale considering the focus on the effect of shear and looking at a length scale while focusing on the effect of viscosit
