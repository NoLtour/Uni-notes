## Approximating a turbulent BL profile
Basically the same similarity discussed in [[similarity in boundary layer velocity profiles]] which was used in [[approximating a laminar BL profile]] can be applied to turbulent boundary layers. The difference is that instead of the flow profile being equivilent to a parabolic equation it's an exponential relationship:

[[complex fourier series]]

>> $U_{\infty}=$ freestream velocity
>> $u=$ velocity
>> $y=$ position normal to flat plate
>> $\delta=$ [[boundary layer thickness]]
>> $n=$ a value specific to that turbulant boundary layer, which needs to be found through curve fitting
