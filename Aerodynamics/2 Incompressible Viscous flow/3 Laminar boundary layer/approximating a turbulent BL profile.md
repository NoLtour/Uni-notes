## Approximating a turbulent BL profile
Basically the same similarity discussed in [[similarity in boundary layer velocity profiles]] which was used in [[approximating a laminar BL profile]] can be applied to turbulent boundary layers. The difference is that instead of the flow profile being equivilent to a parabolic equation it's an exponential relationship:

[[complex fourier series]]
