## Direct numerical simulation
A direct numerical simulation is a simulation in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in which the [[navier stokes equations]] are numerically solved without any [[turbulence model]]. This means that the whole range of spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence must be resolved.

So you're going to need a super computer [[defenition of a skill issue|lol]].
