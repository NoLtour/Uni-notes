## Approximating a laminar BL profile
We know from [[similarity in boundary layer velocity profiles]] that for flow over a plate if you know the flow profile at one point in the flow, you can scale it for any other point in the flow (as long as it's the same type of flow). It is therefore possible to derive equations defining flow at any point on the plate and subsequently characteristics of the flow if you have a accurate model for flow profile; here we are going to assume the following flow profile:

Or expressed mathamatically:
$$ u(y) = \begin{dcases} U_{\infty} \frac{y}{\delta} & for\:\: y<\delta \\ U_{\infty}  & for\:\:y\geq\delta \end{dcases} $$
Plugging this into the equations of [[boundary layer momentum thickness|momentum thickness]] and [[boundary layer displacement thickness|displacement thickness]]
