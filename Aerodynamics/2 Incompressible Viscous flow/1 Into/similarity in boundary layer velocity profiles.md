## Similarity in boundary layer velocity profiles

For a flat plate, the velocity profile of the [[boundary layer]] is the same if plotted in normalised form (y axis is $y/\delta$ and x axis is $u/U_{\infty}$) for areas with the same type of flow (laminar/turbulent). For example in the following laminar flow:
