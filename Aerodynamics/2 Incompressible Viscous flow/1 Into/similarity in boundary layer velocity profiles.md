## Similarity in boundary layer velocity profiles

For a flat plate, the velocity profile of the [[boundary layer]] is the same if plotted in normalised form (y axis is $y/\delta$ and x axis is $u/U_{\infty}$) for areas with the same type of flow (laminar/turbulent). For example in the following laminar flow:

Both the blue highlighted and red highlighted sections have the same normalised profile as seen on the right. This means that if you know the velocity profile at any point on the plate then all you need so the [[boundary layer thickness]] to get the velocity profile at some other point (assuming same flow regime).
