## Boundary layer thickness ($\delta_{99}$)
### $\delta_{99}$
The [[boundary layer]] is often defined as the distance between the surface and the [[freestream]] where the velocity of the fluid is less than $99$% of the [[freestream]] velocity.

> ### $$ u(\delta_{99}) = 0.99 \times U_\infty  $$
> ### $$ \delta_{99} = u^{-1}( 0.99 \times U_\infty)  $$ 
>> where:
>> $\delta_{99}=$ [[boundary layer thickness]] 
>> $U_\infty=$ [[freestream]] velocity
>> $u(y)=$ the velocity at some point as a function of distance normal to the surface

Note that:
- Boundary layer thickness varies along the surface (obv)
- Boundary layer thickness is useful for non dimensionalising things

### Other ways of categorising thickness
- [[boundary layer momentum thickness]]
- [[boundary layer displacement thickness]]
