## Effective body and flow

If we consider the flow around a body with no boundary layer (aka [[inviscid flow]]) then we'd get the following:

Now consider the streamlines around the same object but now the flow is [[viscous flow|viscous]], leading to the formation of a [[boundary layer]]. Using the definition of [[boundary layer displacement thickness|displacement thickness]] we can show how the streamlines are deflected:

What should be noted is that since streamlines can't cross, in a 2D situation there is no difference between a [[inviscid flow]] where
