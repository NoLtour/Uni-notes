## Momentum thickness and [[skin drag|viscous drag]]

There is a direct relationship between [[skin drag|skin friction]] and [[boundary layer momentum thickness|momentum thickness]]:

> ## $$ D(x) = \rho U_{\infty}^{2} \times \theta(x) $$ 
>> where:
>> $D(x)=$ total [[skin drag|viscous drag]] caused up to that point as a function of $x$
>> $\theta(x)=$ [[boundary layer momentum thickness|momentum thickness]] as a function of $x$
>> $x=$ position on object
>> $\rho=$ density
>> $U_{\infty}=$ [[freestream]] velocity
