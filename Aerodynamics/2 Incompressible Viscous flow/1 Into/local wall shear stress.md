## Local wall shear stress ($\tau_{w}$)

This is simply the shear stress at the wall between the fluid and the solid.

It can be integrated to get [[skin drag]]:

> ## $$ D' = \int^{x}_{0} \tau_{w} dx $$ 
> ## $$ \tau_{w} = \frac{dD'}{dx} $$
>> where:
>> $D'(x)=$ total [[skin drag|viscous drag]] caused up to that point as a function of $x$ 
>> $x=$ position on object 
>> $\tau_{w}=$ [[local wall shear stress]]
>> This is in 2D
