## Kelvin's circulation theorem

Basically this is [[conservation of angular momentum]], but for thinking about [[circulation]]:

$$ \frac{D\Gamma}{Dt} = 0 $$

The change in total [[circulation]] over time is zero, because if circulation is created then equal and opposite circulation must also be created. When considering the [[inviscid flow]] environment that we've been working in inside this module it leads to the creation of a "starting vortex":

(Here $\Gamma_{4}=$circulation of airfoil, $\Gamma_{3}=$circulation of starting vortex, $\Gamma_{1,2}=$initial and final circulation of system)

The starting vortex moves away from the airfoil over time, this is one of the reasons why planes can't take off one after another. In the inviscid model the starting vortex will persist forever but in a model with viscosity (such as real life) frictional forces cause it to dissipate.
