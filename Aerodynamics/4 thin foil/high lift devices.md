## High lift devices
### Intro

We have shown in [[thin cambered airfoil analysis]] that you can increase $\alpha_{L=0}$ and hence max lift noteably by increasing camber, to achieve this you don't nessisarily need to just have a constant shape foil which is impractical considering the preformance requirement differences between takeoff, cruse and landing. (As discussed in first year [[Mechanics of flight read order|mechanics of flight stuff]]) 

### Flaps

Simple way of increasing camber bend the end of the foil ([[flaps]]), better add a hinge and make it controllable:

### Slats

Ok so here is a revolutionary thought... what if instead of bending the end, we bend the front? ([[slats]])

### Practical implementation

In real life we will use both to get some very [[it just looks so cool|based]] looking wings:

Which completely changes the lift characteristics depending on what is needed!
