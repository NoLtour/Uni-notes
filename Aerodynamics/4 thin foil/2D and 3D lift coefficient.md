## 2D and 3D lift coefficient

This is a really important distinction, so far we've generally been talking about 3D [[lift coefficient]] $C_{L}$, but when working in 2D we use $C_{l}$ and something that is really important is that $C_{l} \neq C_{L}$ these should not be confused when doing working else you will get the wrong results:
[[lift equation]]
> ### $$\begin{align*}  3D:&\:\: C_L =  \frac{2L}{\rho U_{\infty}^{2} S} \\ 2D:&\:\: C_l =  \frac{2L'}{\rho U_{\infty}^{2} c} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $C_{L}=$ 3D [[lift coefficient]]
>> $C_{l}=$ 2D lift coefficient
>> $L=$ [[lift equation|lift]]
>> $L'=$ lift per unit span
>> $U_{\infty}=$ freestream velocity
>> $S=$ [[Wing span]]
>> $\rho=$ fluid density
>> $c=$ [[chord (aeronautics)|chord length]]
