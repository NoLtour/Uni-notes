## Rankine oval

We can get a shape called a [[Rankine oval]] by placing a source and a sink in a uniform flow:

To simplify things it's best to place the source and sink on the x axis with equal distance $b$ from the origin.

The maths to get the [[stream function (2D)|stream function]] can be recycled from [[stream function for a doublet]]
