## Stream function for a vortex

Consider a flow which is irrotational for all points except for the origin which has a [[circulation]] of $\Gamma$:

The radial and angular velocities can be described as:
$$\begin{align*}
V_{\theta} &= \frac{c}{r} & V_{r} &=0
\end{align*}$$
Then we can use the identity of [[circulation]], but first we need to know the area of interest; here we know that the total [[circulation]] within any sized circle around the origin is $a$
