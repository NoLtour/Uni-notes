## Pressure coefficients for a stream function in a potential flow

### Theory

It's quite easy just take the equation for [[pressure coefficient when there is no freestream|pressure coefficient]] and then use the same sort of method we did for finding [[defining the geometry of an object in a flow#Finding thickness|thickness of a object in freestream]] from it's streamfunction, but for the pressure coefficient:

![[pressure coefficient when there is no freestream#^6ace8a]]

### Example

[[Flow past a circular cylinder]],
