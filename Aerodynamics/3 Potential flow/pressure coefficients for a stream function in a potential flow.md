## Pressure coefficients for a stream function in a potential flow

### Theory

It's quite easy just take the equation for [[pressure coefficient when there is no freestream|pressure coefficient]] and then use the same sort of method we did for finding [[defining the geometry of an object in a flow#Finding thickness|thickness of a object in freestream]] from it's streamfunction, but for the pressure coefficient:

![[pressure coefficient when there is no freestream#^6ace8a]]

### Example

If we use the basic example from before from [[defining the geometry of an object in a flow#Describing the geometry]], then we define $r$ interms of $\theta$ using the equation of the followed stream function:

$$\begin{align*}
1 &= \frac{2U_{\infty}}{Q}  r \theta + \frac{\theta}{\pi} \\
\frac{1-\frac{\theta}{\pi}}{\frac{2U_{\infty}\theta}{Q}} &= r\\
Q\frac{1-\frac{\theta}{\pi}}{ 2U_{\infty}\theta } &= r
\end{align*}$$

This can then be subbed into an equation of
