## Coordinate system being used in potential flow
### Change
For the [[Potential flow Overview|potential flow notes]] we will be using this really stupid convention for coordinates instead of what we usually have. Why you ask? Because people of the [[I really hate this sort of thing with an unreasonable passion|past are stupid]] and inconsonant and no one has fixed it because changing the conventions too hard.

Essentially the change is that instead of using $y$ as the vertical direction, we use $z$ as the vertical and $y$ as the span wise.

### Consequential equations
Now all the equations we defined such as [[euler equations for inviscid and incompressible flow|euler equations]] are now inconsistent with the new coordinates so need to be adjusted (fucking cringe) where:
- $y\to z$
- $z \to y$
- $v \to w$
- $w \to v$

Note that $w$ is equivalent to $V_{z}$.
