## Kutta-Joukowski Theorem

So you know how for [[flow over a rotating cylinder]] when we did all that work for finding drag and it just turned out to be zero? Well turns out that for a potential flow it is __always__ zero regardless of shape or free stream. The result found for the lift is also always $L'=\rho V_{\inft} \Gamma$.

Put in a nice format, when working with potential flows regardless of the object:

> ## $$ D' = 0 $$ 
> ## $$ L' = \rho V_{\infty} \Gamma $$ 
>> where:
>> $D'=$ drag per unit length
>> $L'=$ lift per unit length
>> $\rho=$ fluid density
>> $V_{\infty}=$ free stream velocity
>> $\Gamma=$ [[circulation]]
