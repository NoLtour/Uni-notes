## Stream function for line source or sink

### Derivation

![[Pasted image 20221106164053.png]]

If we take the origin at the point of the source/sink the maths becomes much cleaner. This is the same method as [[stream function for uniform flow#Derivation]] except now we will use the polar form of [[stream function (2D)|stream function]]. It is clear from observation that the angular velocity is zero, the radial velocity is a bit more complex.
