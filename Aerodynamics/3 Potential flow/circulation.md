## Circulation ($\Gamma$)
Circulation is a measure of a region of a [[vector fields|vector field]] to rotate, if you define a region using the closed curve $C$:

Then we can define the contribution to total circulation at some point on the curve as the tangential velocity to the path $C$, hence it is the component of $V$ acting in the same direction of $C$ at some point and can therefor be described using a [[dot product (vectors)|dot product]]:
$$ d\Gamma = \vec{V} \cdot d\vec{s} $$
