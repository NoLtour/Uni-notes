## Circulation ($\Gamma$)
Circulation is a measure of a region of a [[vector fields|vector field]] to rotate, if you define a region using the closed curve $C$:

Then we can define the contribution to total circulation at some point on the curve as the [[dot ]]:
$$ d\Gamma = \underline{V} \cdot d\underline{s} $$
(making use of [[dot product (vectors)|dot product]])
