## Circulation ($\Gamma$)
Circulation is a measure of a region of a [[vector fields|vector field]] to rotate (like [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] but over some area), if you define a region using the closed curve $C$:

Then we can define the contribution to total circulation at some point on the curve as the tangential velocity to the path $C$, hence it is the component of $V$ acting in the same direction of $C$ at some point and can therefor be described using a [[dot product (vectors)|dot product]]:
$$ d\Gamma = \vec{V} \cdot d\vec{s} $$
Then of course if we do this around the entire curve we get the integral:
$$ \Gamma = \int_{C} \vec{V} \cdot d\vec{s} $$

You know how I said it's "kinda" like [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] but over an area, well I lied. It can litterally be defined as [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] but over an area:
$$ \Gamma $$
