## Flow over a rotating cylinder
We've already done lots of analysis on [[Flow past a circular cylinder]], but things get interesting once we add a [[stream function for a vortex|vortex]] into the mix:

For convenience we add in the term $\epsilon$ such that the stream function for the stagnation point is zero, since when dealing with stream functions we only really work with the derivative adding any constant to the stream function won't change any outputs, hence we can do this without negative consequence.
