# Potential flow Overview

#### Intro and contents
Potential flow is [[inviscid flow|inviscid]] hence is not useful for calculating drag, however it is quite accurate at predicting lift and giving a reasonably accurate estimation of the flow around an object. It is very useful for early stages of development since it's quick and not computationally intensive.
