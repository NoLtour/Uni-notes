## Comparison between potential flow and real flows

Potential flow analysis is a descent approximation for low Reynolds number problems, as can be seen above. As the flow becomes increasingly turbulent the model begins to seriously [[IS THAT A FALL GUYS REFRENCE|fall apart]]. Which becomes especially intresting since for potential flow problems we are assuming [[viscosity]] to be zero which should result in high Reynolds number situations:
