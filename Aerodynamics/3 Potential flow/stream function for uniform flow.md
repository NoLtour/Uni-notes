## Stream function for uniform flow
Honestly the whole idea of [[stream function (2D)|stream function]] is kinda abstract, but it is essentially a function that describes the shape of flow.

Lets say we want to find the stream function for a uniform flow:

It's clear that for this sort of uniform flow that:
$$\begin{align*}
V_{z} = w &= U_{\infty} \sin \alpha & V_{x} = u &= U_{\infty} \cos \alpha 
\end{align*}$$
Then we can take the definition of [[stream function (2D)|stream function]] and the method for [[derivative symbols|integrating partial derivatives]]
