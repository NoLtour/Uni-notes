## Pressure coefficient when there is no freestream
In the event where for some reason there is no uniform flow, usually caused by a source or a sink there is no value for [[freestream]] velocity, in this case we need to redefine pressure coefficient. Since in practical terms freestream velocity is just a convenient number used to non dimensionalise problems and acting as a refrence, all we need to replace it is something else that
