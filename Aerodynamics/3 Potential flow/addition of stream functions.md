## Addition of stream functions
### Idea
We know that  [[laplace equation for flow|Laplace equation]] contains a definition regarding [[stream function (2D)|stream functions]]:

$$ 0 = \frac{\delta^{2} \psi}{\delta x^{2}} + \frac{\delta^{2} \psi}{\delta  y^{2}} $$

It can be seen that this equation which describes flow is linear, hence solutions to this equation can be superimposed on each other:

$$\psi = \psi_{1}+ \psi_{2}+ \psi_{3}+...+ \psi_{n}$$

This means that by adding multiple stream functions to each other it is possible to get more complex resultant flows:
