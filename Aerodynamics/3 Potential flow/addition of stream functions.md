## Addition of stream functions
We know that  [[laplace equation for flow|Laplace equation]] contains a definition regarding [[stream function (2D)|stream functions]]:

$$ 0 = \frac{\delta^{2} \psi}{\delta x^{2}} + \frac{\delta^{2} \psi}{\delta  y^{2}} $$

It can be seen that this equation which defines flow
