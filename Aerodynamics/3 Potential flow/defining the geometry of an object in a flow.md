## Defining the geometry of an object in a flow

We know from previous discussions that a streamline is effectively equivalent to a solid boundary in 2D space since mass cannot flow across streamlines. We also know that it is possible to construct complex stream geometrys from [[addition of stream functions]], combining this knowledge: it is possible to create a desired geometry using [[addition of stream functions]] then by treating one of the streamlines as the solid body we want to study we can ge
