## Defining the geometry of an object in a flow
### Intro
We know from previous discussions that a streamline is effectively equivalent to a solid boundary in 2D space since mass cannot flow across streamlines. We also know that it is possible to construct complex stream geometrys from [[addition of stream functions]], combining this knowledge: it is possible to create a desired geometry using [[addition of stream functions]] then by treating one of the streamlines as the solid body we want to study we can get the characteristics of the flows interaction with it by looking at the surrounding flow.
