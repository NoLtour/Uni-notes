## Stagnation point
 A stagnation point is a point in a flow field where the local velocity of the fluid is zero. The pressure at a stagnation point is [[stagnation pressure]].

On a streamlined body fully immersed in a [[Potential flow Overview|potential flow]], there are two stagnation pointsâ€”one near the leading edge and one near the trailing edge. On a body with a sharp point such as the trailing edge of a wing, a stagnation point is located at that point. The streamline at a stagnation point is perpendicular to the surface of the body.
