#### How do you go about
## Calculating truss deformation
The extention of the truss can be calculated using [[Stress]] and [[Strain]] equations.


<div style="-webkit-column-count: 2; -moz-column-count: 2; column-count: 2; -webkit-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; -moz-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0;">
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
		ffs
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
		# AHHHH
    </div>

This is for a [[pin jointed trusses|pin jointed truss]], so there are some primary assumptions we work on:
- Bars extend/contract axially
- Bars are free to rotate around pin joints
- Bars always remain attacked to each other at the joints

It's best to use an example, consider:
