#### What are
## Statically determinate and indeterminate beams
### Introduction
Recall [[statically indeterminate trusses]] and [[statically indeterminate trusses]], well this is basically the same thing but for beams.

If we recall that for most situations where you have to calculate something to do with a beam the first step is to calculate support reaction forces:

Well depending on the amount of knows and unknowns you may or may not have enough information.


### Definition

If you have enough equations to work out the unknown's acting on a beam we call that a statically determinate beam, else if we don't have enough information to find the values of the forces acting on the beam we call those statically indeterminate beams.
