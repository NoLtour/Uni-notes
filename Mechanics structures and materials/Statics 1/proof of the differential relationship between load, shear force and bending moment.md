## Proof of the differential relationship between load, shear force and bending moment

If we take the following diagram:

Then try to analyse it using [[method for constructing shear force and bending moment diagrams|method for evaluating shear force and bending moment diagrams]]:

We can get a diagram for a beam segment

Vertical equalibrium:
$$\begin{align*}
Q &= Q+dQ + dx\cdot w(x)
\end{align*}$$
Here we can approximate the load as
