#### How do we go about
## Modelling shear stress in beams
### Bending stress ($M$) distrobution
We already know how to model the internal [[strains effects on cross section of a beam]] which also leads into the following stress distrobution over a beams cross section:

This shows us that [[shear stress]] must exist in the longitudional axis of the beam.

### Shear force ($Q$) distrobution
