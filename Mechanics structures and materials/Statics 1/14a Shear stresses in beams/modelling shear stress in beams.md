#### How do we go about
## Modelling shear stress in beams
### Intro

#### Bending moment ($M$) distrobution
We already know how to model the internal [[strains effects on cross section of a beam]] which also leads into the following stress distrobution over a beams cross section:

This shows us that [[shear stress]] ($\sigma_{xx}$) must exist in the longitudional axis of the beam.

#### Shear force ($Q$) distrobution
From some of the first content in [[shearing force in beams]] we know that $Q$ is a verticle shear stress ($\sigma_{yx}$):
