#### How can you find
## Average shear stress in a beam cross section
This is very simple, it will just be the total shear stress ($Q$) devided by the area of the cross section:

> ### $$ \sigma_{yx\:average} = \frac{Q}{A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{yx\:average}=$ [[average shear stress in a beam cross section]]
>> $Q=$ shear force
>> $A=$ cross sectional area
