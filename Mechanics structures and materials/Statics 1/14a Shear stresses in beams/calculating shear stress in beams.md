#### Whats the method for
## Calculating shear stress in beams
### Intro
Well we know the basics from [[modeling shear stress in beams]], and now we know about all the different planes shear can act in. Importantly we also established that shear stresses can be related to $M$ and $Q$ so it becomes important to start with looking at how they vary along the beam [[Relationships between distributed load, shear force and bending moment]]
