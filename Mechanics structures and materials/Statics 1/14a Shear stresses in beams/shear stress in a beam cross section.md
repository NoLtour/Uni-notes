#### How can you find
## Shear stress in a beam cross section


### Proof
To find the shear stress at a specific point we are going to have to do some maeth, consider the following:

We know that the stress at a given point along the face is given in [[engineer's bending theory]]:

Now remember how we showed in previous notes that $Q$ at any point along a beam could be expressed by starting from one side and moving to the other (see [[method for constructing shear force and bending moment diagrams]]), basically we are going to employ a simular method to calculate the sum of the shear forces on a cut face
