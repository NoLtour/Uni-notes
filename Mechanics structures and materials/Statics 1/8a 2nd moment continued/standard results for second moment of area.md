#### What are the
## Standard results for [[second moment of area]]
### Requirements
To use these equations the shape must have it's centre go through the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]] as shown in the diagrams assosiated with them, you can of course divide the values by 2 if the top half of the shape is above the axis.

### Circular cross section

To do the proof you need to integrate using polar coordinates.

> ### $$ I_{zz} = \frac{\pi D^4}{64} $$

>> $D=$ Diameter of the circle 
>> $I_{zz}=$ [[second moment of area]]
