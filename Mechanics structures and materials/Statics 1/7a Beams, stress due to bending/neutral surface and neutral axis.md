#### What is a
## Neutral surface and neutral axis
#### Neutral surface
Between two surfaces that are in compression and tension there must be points along that stress gradient where stress = 0. Since compression and tension are continous throughout a material it could be shown as a surface, hence a neutral surface:

It is useful to define, because then we can figure out stresses relative to it.

#### Neutral axis
