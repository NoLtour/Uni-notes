#### How can you model
## Deformation due to bending in beams
###  Introduction

First if we picture a beam:

Then apply a bending moment to it:

You can get an intuitive feeling that it would compress towords the top and stretch towords the bottom, but as you can see the plane cross section remains strait.

### Assumptions
Of course in reality everything has [[random idk|unexpected behaviour]], so for analysis we are going to work under some assumtions:
- The plane cross section remains a plane under loading conditions
- The beam is bent into a circular arc
- The radius of curviture of the circle is large compared to the thickness of the beam
- Tensile and compressive stresses act longitudionaly
- The beam is expressing linear elastic behaviour and has the same [[youngs modulus]] for both tension and compression

#### Explenation of what that means
This is what we mean by "modelling it as a circular arc", this is exagerated though. In reality we would model it as a much more gentle curve.

This is the origional beam segment that gets defomed in the image above.

As you can see the top gets compressed and the bottoms in tension, of course depending on the way the moments and [[shear stress]] is applied will change where it is under compression and tension.
