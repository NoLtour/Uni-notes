#### How can you model
## Deformation due to bending in beams
###  Introduction

First if we picture a beam:

Then apply a bending moment to it:

You can get an intuitive feeling that it would compress towords the top and stretch towords the bottom, but as you can see the plane cross section remains strait.

### Assumptions
Of course in reality everything has [[random idk|unexpected behaviour]], so for analysis we are going to work under some assumtions:
- The plane cross section remains a plane under loading conditions
- The beam is bent into a circular arc
- The radius of curviture of the circle is large compared to the depth of the beam
-
