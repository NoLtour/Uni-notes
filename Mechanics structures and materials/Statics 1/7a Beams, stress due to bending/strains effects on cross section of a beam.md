#### What is
## Strains effects on cross section of a beam
If we look at how strain varies through the depth of a beam, [[longitudinal strain in a beam#Implications]]. 

![[longitudinal strain in a beam#^a731ed]]

We can start to predict how the cross section of the beam changes with this strain using the materials [[poisson's ratio]]:

![[poisson's ratio#^43d8df]]
