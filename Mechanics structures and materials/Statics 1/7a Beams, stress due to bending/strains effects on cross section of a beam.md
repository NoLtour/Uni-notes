#### What is
## Strains effects on cross section of a beam

![[Pasted image 20211108111242.png]]

If we look at how strain varies through the depth of a beam, [[longitudinal strain in a beam#Implications]]. 

![[longitudinal strain in a beam#^a731ed]]

We can start to predict how the cross section of the beam changes with this strain using the materials [[poisson's ratio]]:

![[poisson's ratio#^43d8df]]

We can also use [[Hooke's law]], now lets do some meht:

$$ \begin{align*}
\epsilon_{xx} &=  & \epsilon_{xx} &= \frac{y}{R}\\
&
\end{align*} $$
