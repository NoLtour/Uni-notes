#### How do you find
## Longitudinal strain in a beam
#### Important definitions
First we need a refrence point for this we use the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]]:
![[neutral surface and neutral axis]]

We will work under the same assumptions as from [[deformation due to bending in beams#Assumptions]].

### Ma(e)th

If we get a general equation for [[Strain|strain]] ($\epsilon_{xx}$) on the surface A' B':
$$ \epsilon_{xx} = \frac{A'B'-AB}{AB} $$

Here $AB$ represents the origional dimentions of the beam so since the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral surface]] is equivilent and equal:
$$ \begin{align*}
AB = A_0'B_0' = Rd\theta
\end{align*} $$
Note that $Rd\theta$ uses radians
