#### What's a
## Bending moment
If we take the following example:

Then cut the [[beam]] at any point the bending moment is $M$:

So a bending moment is the internal moment required for rotational equalibrium.

The bending moment in this example can be expressed as $M=fd$, meaning the bending moment will be uniform along the length of the beam.

It should also be noted that this bending moment is made up of stresses across the beams cross section, meaning stress is n
