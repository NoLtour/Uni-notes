#### What is
## Sign convention for beams
Consider the following beam segment and it's left and right faces:

> A positive [[shearing force in beams|shear force]] produces clockwise rotation.
> ![[Pasted image 20211025111810.png]]
>  This is the standard arrow direction when labelling shear force on a beam.

> A positive [[bending moment]] at a cut face produces a sagging effect on a beam.

>  This is the standard arrow direction when labelling bending moments on a beam.

Whenever labelling diagrams this is the convention we stick to, of couse the values of Q and M can be negative but the arrow direction must be in this format.

### Example

We can split it and apply the sign convention when labelling:

So then focusing on the left segment:

> Vertical eqilibrium
> $$ \begin{align*}
1000 + Q =& 0\\
Q &= -1000
\end{align*} $$

> Rotational eqilibrium:
> $$ \begin{align*}
1000x + M =& 0\\
M=& -1000x
\end{align*} $$
