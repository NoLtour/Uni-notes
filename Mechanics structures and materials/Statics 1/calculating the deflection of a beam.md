#### Whats the method for
## Calculating the deflection of a beam
### Useful bits
We use the same assumptions as those from [[]]

### Proof
Since we are modelling under the same assumptions as those for [[engineer's bending theory]], we can assume the distance to the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]] of the beam is $R$:

This also means we can define deflection ($v$) as a function of $x$ hence $v(x)$.
