#### Whats the method for
## Calculating the deflection of a beam
### Useful bits
We use the same assumptions as those from [[deformation due to bending in beams#Assumptions]] which are also used for [[engineer's bending theory]].

When we measure deflection we take it in respect to the origional strait beam's position, with downwards deflections being negative.

### Proof
Since we are modelling under the same assumptions as those for [[engineer's bending theory]], we can assume the distance to the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]] of the beam is $R$:

This also means we can define deflection ($v$) as a function of $x$ hence $v(x)$.

Ok so since we are modelling the beam as a circular arc, it can be drawn as the following:

Since the circular arc is assumed to be very large, we can say that $ds \approx ds$ and we also know that $\tan \theta = \frac{dv}{dx} \approx \theta$ so:
$$\begin{align*}
    &= 
\end{align*}$$
