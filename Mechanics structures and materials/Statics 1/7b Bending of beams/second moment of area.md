## Second moment of area
Refer to [[moment over a section of beam cross section]] for proof and stuff.

> ### $$ M = \frac{EI}{R} = \frac{EI_{zz}}{R} = \frac{E}{R} \int \int y^{2} \cdot dy\cdot dz $$ 
>> where:
>> $M=$ anticlockwise moment about the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]]  
>> $E=$ [[modulus of elasticity]]
>> $R=$ Radius of circle
>> $I_{zz}=I=\int \int y^{2} \cdot dy\cdot dz=$ The resistance to bending due to the geometry of the beams cross section
