#### What is
## Force over a section of beam cross section

$$ F = \sigma_{xx}(dy\cdot dz) $$
But getting the force of a neglibible sized points kinda useless (shock), now if only there was some method... something that could find the area enclosed by a graph, if only that existed. It would be amazing.
I know well guess what, it's called calculus and it is
