#### What is the
## Shear modulus ($G$)
This is basically the [[youngs modulus]] of a material for relating shear stress and shear strain. It can be found using [[poisson's ratio]]:

> ### $$ G = \frac{E}{2(1+\nu)} $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ [[youngs modulus]]
>> $\nu=$ [[poisson's ratio]]
>> $G=$ [[shear modulus]]

> ### $$ G = \frac{\tau}{\gamma} $$ 
>> where:
>> $G=$ [[shear modulus]]
>> $\tau=$ [[shear stress in a circular beam (torsion)]]
>> $\gamma=$ [[shear strain in a circular beam (torsion)]]
