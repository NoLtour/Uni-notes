#### What are the
## Torsion equations

These can be derived from [[torque and deformation in a circular beam#Proof]].

> ### $$ \frac{T}{J} = \frac{G\theta}{L} = \frac{\tau}{r} $$ 
>> where:
>> $r=$ distance from beam centre
>> $G=$ [[shear modulus]]
>> $L=$ Beam length
>> $\theta=$ Rotation between beam faces
>> $J=$ [[polar second moment of area]]
>> $T=$ Torque
>> $\tau=$ [[shear stress in a circular beam (torsion)]]

Note that it is quite simular to
