#### What is the relationship between
## Torque and deformation in a circular beam


### Proof
We know that torsion is just a moment acting around the midpoint:

If we take a slice as shown above, then find the force acting over a small distance and multiply it by the distance from where we are taking moments about (the centre) we can find the moment that counteracts the torque.
This force that is acting over the small distance can be expressed using the known [[shear stress in a circular beam (torsion)|stress that acts here]].

So we can get an expression for the moments of this small slice:

$$\begin{align*}
T &= 
\end{align*}$$
