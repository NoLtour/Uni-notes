#### How can we model
## Shear strain in a circular beam

If we look back at [[basic properties of circular shafts under torsion]], we can see how the beam changes shape under rotation:

By focusing on a small section (represented in red) we can see that there is a shear force. To simplify the diagram lets get a 2D representation of this:

We can find sheer stain:

$$\begin{align*}
strain &= \frac{extention}{orig\:len}\\
&
\end{align*}$$
