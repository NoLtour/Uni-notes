#### How can you model
## Shear stress in a circular beam (torsion)
### Equation

> ### $$ \tau (r) = \frac{Gr\theta}{L} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\tau=$ [[shear stress in a circular beam (torsion)]] 
>> $r=$ position along radius of cross section
>> $G=$ [[shear modulus]]
>> $\theta=$ rotation of beam faces
>> $L=$ length of beam 

### Proof
Note we are still assuming that the beam doesn't expand latterally due to torsion, this is clearly false but considering how little it does change dimentions is a resonable assumption especially with how much it simplifies the maths.
Continueing with the diagram from [[shear strain in a circular beam (torsion)]]:

If we focus on shear stress it looks like:

Where $\tau$ is the shear stress. Now we can relate that to [[shear strain in a circular beam (torsion)]] using the [[shear modulus]].

$$\begin{align*}
G &= \frac{\tau}{\gamma}  & \gamma &= \frac{R\theta}{L}\\
G &= \frac{\tau}{\frac{R\theta}{L}}\\
\therefore \frac{GR\theta}{L} &= \tau
\end{align*}$$

But so far we have been focusing on the outermost surface of the cylinder, this is an easy fix:

You can clearly see that shear strain will increase as r increases (left image), since stress and strain are proportional, strain will hence increase proportionally with r (right image).
Hence we can simply replace $R$ (radius of cylinder) with $r$ (any position along the radius of the beam):

$$\begin{align*}
 \therefore \tau & = \frac{Gr\theta}{L}
\end{align*}$$
