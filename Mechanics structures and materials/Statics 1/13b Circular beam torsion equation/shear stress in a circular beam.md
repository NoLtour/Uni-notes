#### How can you model
## Shear stress in a circular beam

Continueing with the diagram from [[shear strain in a circular beam]]:

If we focus on shear stress it looks like:

Where $\tau$ is the shear stress.

We can use [[poisson's ratio]] to find stress using strain, which we got from [[shear strain in a circular beam]]



Note we are still assuming that the beam doesn't expand latterally due to torsion, this is clearly false but considering how little it does change dimentions is a resonable assumption especially with how much it simplifies the maths.
