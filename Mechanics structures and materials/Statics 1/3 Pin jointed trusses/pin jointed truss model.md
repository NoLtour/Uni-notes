#### What is a
## Pin jointed truss model
It is a simplified model of reality, where:
- Each beam of the truss is modelled as a bar
- All bars are connected by pins
- It's assumed bars can rotate around the pins with no friction
- All external forces and reactions are applied only in 

These assumtions make it so that there are only axial forces acting through the bar, but each bar has no moments.

In reality the model is only valid if the joints are flexable enough to approximate moments to be negligible.
