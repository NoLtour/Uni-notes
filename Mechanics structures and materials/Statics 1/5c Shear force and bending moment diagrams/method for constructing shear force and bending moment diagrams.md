#### What is the
## Method for constructing shear force and bending moment diagrams
There are a few steps you go through:
1) Label and calcuate support reactions


### Example
Given:

We would:
1)
> Although the [[types of supports for beams#Types of supports for beams|pin]] can excert a horizontal reaction the lack of any horizontal forces means we know that the horizontal reaction would be zero, hence no reason to draw it.
