#### What is the
## Method for constructing shear force and bending moment diagrams
There are a few steps you go through:
1) Label and calcuate support reactions and moments
2) 


### Example
Given:
![[Pasted image 20211025114801.png]]

We would:
1)
> Although the [[types of supports for beams#Types of supports for beams|pin]] can excert a horizontal reaction the lack of any horizontal forces means we know that the horizontal reaction would be zero, hence no reason to draw it.

> Also note that here we approximated the load as a point load, this would be done to figure out reaction forces but in later steps we will be calculating [[bending moment]]s and [[shearing force in beams|shearing force]]s so we will not model it as a point load then
