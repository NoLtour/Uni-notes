#### What's 
## Ultimate Tensile Strength
This is the maximum [[Stress]] that a material can experience before fracture.

When plotting with [[engineering stress and strain|engineering stress]] the stress may appear to drop before final failure, this is because the cross sectional area is decreasing and we arn't accounting for it properly.
