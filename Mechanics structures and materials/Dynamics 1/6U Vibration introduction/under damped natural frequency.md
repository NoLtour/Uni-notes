#### What is the equation for
## Under damped natural frequency

> ### $$ \omega_{d} = \omega_{n} \sqrt{1-\zeta^{2}} = \sqrt{(1-\zeta^{2}) \frac{k}{m} } $$ 
>> where:
>> $\omega_{d}=$ [[under damped natural frequency]]
>> $\omega_{n}=$ [[free vibration (dynamics)|natural frequency]]
>> $\zeta=$ [[types of dampening (dynamics)|damping ratio]]
>> $m=$ mass
>> $k=$ [[spring constant]]
