#### What are the
## Types of dampening (dynamics)
This is the same as [[types of dampening (differentuially modeeled oscillator)]], here we can define:

> ### $$ \zeta = \frac{c}{c_{crit}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\zeta=$  [[damping parameter (differentially modelled oscillator)|damping parameter]] for dynamics (also called damping ratio)
>> $c=$ damping coefficient
>> $c_{crit}= 2\sqrt{km} =$ critical damping coefficient (variables from [[modeling vibration (not driven)#^9328aa]])
