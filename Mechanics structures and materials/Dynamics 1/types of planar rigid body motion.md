#### What are the
## Types of planar rigid body motion
There are 4 types in planar motion:
- [[rigid body path of rectilinear translation]]
- [[rigid body path of curvilinear translation]]
- [[rigid body rotation around a fixed axis]]
- [[rigid body general plane motion]]

Although I say 4 types they fit into the broader 2 categories of translation and rotation.
