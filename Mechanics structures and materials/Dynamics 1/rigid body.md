#### What is a
## Rigid body
So far we have been mostly dealing with modelling stuff as particles, here's a real shocker for you: most things aren't accurately represented as a particle. For example your [[get absolutly destroyed and cope mald ratio ect|mother]], modelling that thing as a single point ignores the effect of an awful lot of volume. So instead we can model objects as a collection of connected points:

This is what we call a rigid body. This diagrams in 2D and we will mostly be dealing with 2D but it does work with more dimensions.
