#### Describe
## Rigid body rotation around a fixed axis
### Intro
![[Pasted image 20220427102754.png]]
This is where all points rotate around some defined axis, this also means that all points in the [[rigid body]] have the same angular displacement, velocity and acceleration. In this type of motion all particles of the body move in circular paths perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

It should be noted that when describing rotation around a fixed axis for any [[rigid body]] there is only a single value of angular displacement (accel and vel too) for all points.

### Terms
Here are the variables often used when describing these values.
#### Angular displacement
> ### $$ \theta $$
 
#### Angular velocity
> ### $$ \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \dot{\theta} $$
 
#### Angular acceleration
> ### $$ \alpha = \dot{\omega} = \ddot{\theta} = \frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}} $$
> ### $$ \alpha = \omega \frac{d\omega}{d\theta} $$
