#### How do you calculate
## Work done in dynamics ($U$)
As described in [[Curvilinear motion notes|curvulinear motion]], particles often travel in non strait lines:

In these cases we can find the work done by a force at a given instant by using the [[dot product]] of the force and its direction of travel:

> ### $$ dU = dr \cdot F $$
> ### $$ U_{s_1\to s_2} = \int^{s_2}_{s_1}  \underline{F} \cdot \underline{dr} = \int^{s_2}_{s_1}  F \cos(\theta) dr $$ 
>> where:
>> $U=$ work done 
>> $\underline{F}=$ force [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $\underline{r}=$ displacement

Of course for strait lines where force is constant you can use the simpler $U=F(x_{2}-x_{1})$.
