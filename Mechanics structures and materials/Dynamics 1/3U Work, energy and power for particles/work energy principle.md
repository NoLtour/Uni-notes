#### What is the
## Work energy principle
This equation:

> ### $$ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $KE=$ [[work done in dynamics|work done]] to accelerate the particle from rest
>> $v=$ particle speed 
>> $m=$ particle mass

There is some math to derive it but you can probably [[lazy|figure it out yourself]].
