#### What's the method for
## Modeling particle impacts

We need:
- [[conservation of momentum]]
- [[impulse]]
- This thing: $\underline{v}_{a1} + \underline{v}_{b1} = e(\underline{v}_{a2} + \underline{v}_{b2})$

Or put more nicely:
> ### $$ \underline{v}_{a1} + \underline{v}_{b1} = e(\underline{v}_{a2} + \underline{v}_{b2}) $$ 
>> where:
>> $e=$ [[coefficient of restitution]]
>> $\underline{v}_{a1} + \underline{v}_{b1}=$ velocity component parrallel to [[line of impact]] of particles a and b before collision 
>> $\underline{v}_{a2} + \underline{v}_{b2}=$ velocity component parrallel to [[line of impact]] of particles a and b after collision

Although there is a difference between [[modeling particle impacts|oblique impacts]] and [[modeling particle impacts|central impacts]], the equation above works for both...
