#### What is
## Moment of intertia
Moment of Inertia or Mass moment of inertia is resistance to angular deflection due to applied torque.
I'm resonable sure ([[UNFINISHED STUFF]]) that it's basically just the equation for [[second moment of area]] but with a density term slapped inside the integration.
