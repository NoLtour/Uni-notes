#### What is a
## Moment of linear momentum ($H_{O}, \underline{H_{O}}$)
Moment of linear momentum is basically the general case of [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]].

Moment of momentum measures an objects tendency to continue to spin, it describes the rotary inertia of a system in motion about an axis. It can be applied to situations involving [[Curvilinear motion notes|curvilinear motion]].

### Angular momentum of a point mass

> ### $$ \underline{H_{O}} = \underline{r} \times (m \underline{v}) $$ 
> ### $$ \underline{H_{O}} = \underline{r} \times \underline{p} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{H_{O}}=$ [[moment of linear momentum]]
>> $\underline{p}=$ particles momentum
>> $\underline{r}=$ the position expressed as a displacement vector from the origin (often the point it's rotating around)
>> $m=$ mass
>> $\underline{v}=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> (This is making use of [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]])

The equation above works for 3D and 2D, but for 2D problems it is often easyer to use:

> ### $$ H_{O} = mvr \sin \theta $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$[[UNFINISHED STUFF]]
>> $=$

### Angular momentum of a rotating body
The point mass is kinda useless for most of our use cases,
