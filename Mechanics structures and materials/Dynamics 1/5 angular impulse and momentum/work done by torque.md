#### What is the equation for
## Work done by torque

> ### $$ E = \int \tau \cdot d\theta $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ work done
>> $\tau=$ torque
>> $\theta=$ rotation in direction of torque

> ### $$ E = \tau\theta $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ work done
>> $\tau=$ (constant) torque
>> $\theta=$ rotation in direction of torque
