# Angular momentum and impulse notes

#### Intro and contents
- [[moment of linear momentum]]
- [[relationship between moment of a force and angular momentum]]
- [[rotational acceleration]]
- [[conservation of angular momentum]]
- [[rotational kinetic energy]]
- [[differentiating rotation displacement equations to time]]
- [[idk a meme]]

Something to note it that for questions about the work done by a contracting string, the simplest way is using [[conservation of energy (dynamics)|conservation of energy]] equation and using KE.
