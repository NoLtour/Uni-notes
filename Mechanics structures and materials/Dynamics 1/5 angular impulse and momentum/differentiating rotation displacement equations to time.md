#### Whats the method for
## Differentiating rotation displacement equations to time
Might have this somewhere else in my notes as well buy a bit of redundancy's fine:

> ### $$ v = \omega \frac{dx}{d\theta} $$ 
>> where:
>> $v=$ velocity
>> $\omega=$ angular velocity
>> $\theta=$ angle
>> $x=$ displacement

### Example
Write an expression for $v$ interms of
