#### What is a
## Moment of linear momentum ($H_{O}, \underline{H_{O}}$)
Also known as [[moment of linear momentum|angular momentum]].

Moment of momentum measures an objects tendency to continue to spin, it describes the rotary inertia of a system in motion about an axis. It can be applied to situations involving [[Curvilinear motion notes|curvilinear motion]], the equation defining this for a point mass is:

> ### $$ \underline{H_{O}} = \underline{r} \times m \underline{v} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{H_{O}}=$ [[moment of linear momentum]]
>> $\underline{r}=$ the position expressed as a displacement vector from the origin 
>> $m=$ mass
>> $\underline{v}=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]]

The equation above works for 3D and 2D, but for 2D problems it is often easyer to use:

> ### $$ H_{O} = mvr \sin \theta $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$[[UNFINISHED STUFF]]
>> $=$
