#### Describe
## Acceleration in the n-t coordinate system
![[Pasted image 20220201173804.png]]

We know that acceleration is equal to rate of change of velocity:
$$\begin{align*}
a &= \frac{d\underline{v}}{dt}   &\underline{v}&= v u_{t}\\
&= \frac{d v u_{t}}{dt}\\
&= \frac{d}{dt} v u_{t}
\end{align*}$$

At this point the [[What's the quotient rule|quotient rule]] can be applied:
$$\begin{align*}
a &= \dot{v} u_{t} + v\dot{u_{t}}
\end{align*}$$

(I'm lazy but $u_{t}$ is a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] so I should be writing it as $\underline{u_{t}}$ so [[yes|imagine it looks that way]])
