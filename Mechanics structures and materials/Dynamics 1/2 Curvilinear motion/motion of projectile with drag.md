#### Describe without calculation the
## Motion of projectile with drag
### Getting the thing
Well unlike [[no drag basic projectile motion trajectory equations|projectile motion trajectory equation]] this cannot be easily defined with an equation, if we look back at the [[Drag equation]] then we know that drag $\propto \: v^{2}$, which seems easy enough until you realise that to get $v$ you need $v=\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}$ and things become painful from there, so instead for now just use time steps and approximate the effect by using a tiny increment:

### How it looks graphically

For both of these the only things varied are drag coefficient and initial speed, as you can see drag only starts to have a noticeable effect for great distances... which is that $v^{2}$ term in action as the greater distances are only achievable using a greater speed.
