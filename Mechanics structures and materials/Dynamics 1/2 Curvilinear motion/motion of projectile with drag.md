## Motion of projectile with drag
Well unlike [[no drag basic projectile motion trajectory equations|projectile motion trajectory equation]] this cannot be easily defined with an equation, if we look back at the [[Drag equation]] then we know that drag $\propto \: v^{2}$, which seems easy enough until you realise that to get $v$ you will need to get
