#### What is a
## N-t diagram

### Description

This is an alternative way of represention motion to [[Cartesian coordinates|cartesian coordinates]], here's a description of it:
- Instead of defining the origin/observer externally we use the particle as the origin and define a bunch of things around it. 
- It requires the particles path to be curved and known
- Instead of x,y,z it uses $n,t$ where n is the normal to the curve and t is the tangent to the curve.
- [[radius of curvature|Radius of curvature]] is defined as $\rho$
- The n axis takes the positive direction as towords the [[centre of curvature]]
- The t axis seems to be positive in the direction of motion, not 100% sure if that is alwayse the case if I find an exception I'll change these notes ([[not likely m8|if I remember]])
