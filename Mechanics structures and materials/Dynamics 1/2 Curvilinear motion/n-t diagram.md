#### What is a
## N-t diagram

This is an alternative way of represention motion to [[Cartesian coordinates|cartesian coordinates]], here's a description of it:
- Instead of defining the origin/observer externally we use the particle as the origin and define a bunch of things around it. 
- It requires the particles path to be curved and known
- Instead of x,y,z it uses $\rho=n,$
