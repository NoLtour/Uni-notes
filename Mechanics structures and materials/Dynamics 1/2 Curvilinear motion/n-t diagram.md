#### What is a
## N-t diagram

### Description

This is an alternative way of represention motion to [[Cartesian coordinates|cartesian coordinates]], here's a description of it:
- Instead of defining the origin/observer externally we use the particle as the origin and define a bunch of things around it. 
- It requires the particles path to be curved and known
- Instead of x,y,z it uses $n,t$ where n is the normal to the curve and t is the tangent to the curve.
- [[radius of curvature|Radius of curvature]] is defined as $\rho$
- The n axis takes the positive direction as towords the [[centre of curvature]]
- The t axis seems to be positive in the direction of motion, not 100% sure if that is alwayse the case if I find an exception I'll change these notes ([[not likely m8|if I remember]])

### Variables and relationships

#### Position ($s$)
Position along the curve is usually defined as s and given as a function of time.

#### [[radius of curvature|Radius of curvature]] ($\rho$)
Read ^ 

#### Unit vectors ($u_{n},u_t$)
These [[unit vector]]s define the direction of the tangent (t axis) and the normal (n axis).

#### Velocity ($v,\dot{s}$)
Since the path is along a curve, the velocity will alwayse act along the tangent of the curve and hence $u_{t} v = \dot{s}$

#### Acceleration

### Three dimensional motion
This is coceptually simpler than you would think, basically we label the third axis as $b$ or the binomial axis:

It is the direction in which no motion occurs, remember all the axis change relative to the motion of the ball, so the $n,t$ axis are already enough to fully define the motion of a projectile in 3D space ([[yes|ezzz]]).
