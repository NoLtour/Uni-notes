#### What is
## Relative position
Basically measurements have to be taken relative to something else, since that something else might be moving relative to the origin of your coordinate system ([[absolute position]]) you need to be able to express that.

Take the situation above, you can find $r_{BA}$ using:
> ### $$ r_{BA} = r_{B} - r_{A} $$ 
>> where:
>> $r_{BA}=$ vector A to B
>> $r_{B},r_{A}=$ some vector

And that's litterally it, no clue why there are so many slides on this... it also works for relative velocitys, acceleration ect... not really that [[look the page needed a meme|complex]].
