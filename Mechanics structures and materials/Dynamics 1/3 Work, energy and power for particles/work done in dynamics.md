#### How do you calculate
## Work done in dynamics
As described in [[Curvilinear motion notes|curvulinear motion]], particles often travel in non strait lines:

In these cases we can find the work done by a force at a given instant by using the [[dot product]] of the force and its direction of travel:

> ### $$ dE = dr \cdot F $$
> ### $$ E_{0\to x} = \int^{x}_{0}  F \cdot dr $$ 
>> where:
>> $E=$ work done 
>> $F=$ force [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $r=$ displacement

Of course for strait lines where force is constant you
