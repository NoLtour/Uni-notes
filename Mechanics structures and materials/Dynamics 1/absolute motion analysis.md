#### Describe
## Absolute motion analysis
### Intro
Basically this is just when you have one or more [[rigid body|rigid bodies]] and create a bunch of equations relating how variables describing their motion/position. 

### Basic wheel
Really simple example, a wheel that doesn't slip:

An equation can easily be defined that relates the position of $\underline{G}$ and the rotation of $\theta$.
$$\begin{align*}
s_{G} &= r\theta 
\end{align*}$$
It is then possible to also derive equations for velocity and acceleration:
$$\begin{align*}
v_{g} &= r\dot{\theta} \\
v_{g} &= r\dot{\theta} 
\end{align*}$$
