#### What are
## Elastic and plastic particle impacts
### Stuff
Basically take what you learned from [[modeling particle impacts]] more specifically [[coefficient of restitution]] and:
- $e=1$ means [[elastic and plastic particle impacts|elastic impact]]
- $0<e<1$ non elastic impact, some KE lost
- $e=0$ [[elastic and plastic particle impacts|plastic impact]], maximum energy dissipation (lots of KE loss), after the impact the particles stick together moving off with a single velocity

Heres the slide on how to solve these if you haven't figured it out already:

### Example
Given the following situation:
