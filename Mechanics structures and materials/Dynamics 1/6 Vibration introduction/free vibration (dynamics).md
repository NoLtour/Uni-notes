#### What is
## Free vibration (dynamics)
Also defined [[free vibrations|here]]. This is a special case of oscillation in dynamics where the sum of kinetic energy and elastic energy is conserverd. So basically if we take this eqaution:
![[modeling vibration#^9328aa]]

Then set $c=0$ we get $0=m \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+ kx$, then if we apply [[solving linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equations]]:

$$\begin{align*}
s^{2}m + k &= 0\\
s &= \sqrt\frac{-k}{m} 
\end{align*}$$
