#### What is the mathamatical method for
## Modeling vibration
In the tutorial they start with free oscillation then move onto damped oscillation, that's [[it really is though|kinda cringe]] so I'm going to do it in the opposite order.









### Proof
First lets get a diagram representing some mass on a spring of negligible mass:

Each of the forces are:
- $T(x,\dot{x},\ddot{x}, ...)=$ Some tension force function
- $D(x,\dot{x},\ddot{x}, ...)=$ Some drag force function
- $mg=$ Weight
