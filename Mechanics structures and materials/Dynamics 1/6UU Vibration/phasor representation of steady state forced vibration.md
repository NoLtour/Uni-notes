#### Describe
## Phasor representation of steady state forced vibration
### Intro
Yes this is the same thing as [[phasor representation]] covered in AC, but instead we use it for oscillating systems. We use the following format when representing [[phasor representation|phasors]]:

### Phasors for vibration
Basically phasors are used to relate a input (driving force) to the oscillation:

As long as the frequency of the input is a single constant value then you can represent the relationship between the driving force and output displacement as a frequency response function of the form $\frac{X}{F}$, in steady state this value is constant and can be used:
