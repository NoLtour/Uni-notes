#### Describe
## Phasor representation of steady state forced vibration
### Intro
Yes this is the same thing as [[phasor representation]] covered in AC, but instead we use it for oscillating systems. We use the following format when representing [[phasor representation|phasors]]:
![[phasor representation#^93ff19]]

### Phasors for vibration
Basically phasors are used to relate a input (driving force) to the oscillation:

As long as the frequency of the input is constant
