#### What are the equations for
## Springs in parallel and series
### Parallel

> ### $$ k = k_{1} + k_{2} + ... + k_{n} $$ 
>> where:
>> $k=$ [[spring constant]] of overall structure modelled as single spring
>> $k_{e}=$ the [[spring constant]] of one of the springs in parallel

### Series

> ### $$ k = \frac{1}{ \frac{1}{k_{1}} + \frac{1}{k_{2}} + ... + \frac{1}{k_{n}} } $$ 
>> where:
>> $k=$ [[spring constant]] of overall structure modelled as single spring
>> $k_{e}=$ the [[spring constant]] of one of the springs in series
