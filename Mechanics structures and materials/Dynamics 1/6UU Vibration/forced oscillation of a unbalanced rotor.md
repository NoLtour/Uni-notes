#### What is the equation for the
## Forced oscillation of a unbalanced rotor
Basically if you have some shape where the centre of mass rests on the axis of rotation then there is no force from it's rotation. But if you slap a point mass (or a negative point mass to simulate subtraction) the centrifugal force creates a sinusoidal driving force which can be expressed as the following:

> ### $$ f(t) = m_{\varepsilon} \varepsilon \omega^{2} \angle \omega t $$

>> Note that you should be able to take $m_\varepsilon$ as $|m_\varepsilon|$ in most cases
>> $f(t)=$ force as a function of time 
>> $\omega=$ angular frequency
>> $m_\varepsilon=$ mass of point
>> $\varepsilon=$
