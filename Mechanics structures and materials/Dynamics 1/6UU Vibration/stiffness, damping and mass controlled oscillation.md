#### What is
## Stiffness, damping and mass controlled oscillation
### Intro
This is where one factor of a oscillating system dominates the displacement of a system such that other factors can be ignored due to insignificance. This occurs due the the effect of the $\omega$ term:

If you look at that equation:
- tiny values of $\omega$ will result in the only significant factor being the [[spring constant]] (stiffness)
- high values of $\omega$ will result in the only significant factor being the mass
- moderate values of $\omega$ may result in the [[damping coefficient]] dominating

This is especially evident looking at a force response function plotted against frequency:

### Regions
Note it is also worth considering the magnitude of $k$, $c$ and $m$ since extreme values for these could change when such approximations are appropriate.
