#### What is
## Stiffness, damping and mass controlled oscillation
This is where one factor of a oscillating system dominates the displacement of a system such that other factors can be ignored due to insignificance. This occurs due the the effect of the $\omega$ term:

If you look at that equation:
- tiny values of $\omega$ will result in the only significant factor being the [[spring constant]] (stiffness)
