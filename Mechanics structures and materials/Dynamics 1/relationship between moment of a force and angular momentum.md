#### Describe the
## Relationship between moment of a force and angular momentum

> ### $$ \sum\limits \underline{M_{O}} = \frac{d\underline{H_{O}}}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{M_{O}}=$ Moments acting on object
>> $\underline{H_{O}}=$ [[moment of linear momentum]]

This form kinda sucks so we can rearrange it into:

> ### $$ (\underline{H_{O}})_{1} + \sum\limits \int^{t_{2}}_{t_{1}} \underline{M_{O}}\:\: dt = (\underline{H_{O}})_{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{M_{O}}=$ Moments acting on object
>> $\underline{H_{O}}=$ [[moment of linear momentum]]
>> $t=$ time

Although this looks confusing it basically says initial [[moment of linear momentum|moment of momentum]] plus sum of moment impulses equals final [[moment of linear momentum|moment of momentum]].

Also the reason this page has the alias [[relationship between moment of a force and angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]] is because of [[relationship between moment of a force and angular momentum#^567385|this equation]], this is basically saying that and then some. Of couse
