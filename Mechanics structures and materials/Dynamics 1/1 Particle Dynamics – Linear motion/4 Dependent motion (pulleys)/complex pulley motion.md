#### Describe
## Complex pulley motion
Ok so this is actually really cool, most effective to explain with a diagram:

Think about the relationship between $s_{A}$ and $s_{B}$, you may think initially that it's the same as what we covered in [[basic pulley motion]] but look at the diagram and picture what happens... the motion of $\Delta s_{B} = \frac{1}{2} \Delta s_{A}$, this comes because we have a different equation govening the cord length distrobution:
