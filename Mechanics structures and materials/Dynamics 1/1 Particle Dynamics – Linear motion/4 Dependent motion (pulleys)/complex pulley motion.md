#### Describe
## Complex pulley motion
Ok so this is actually really cool, most effective to explain with a diagram:

Think about the relationship between $s_{A}$ and $s_{B}$, you may think initially that it's the same as what we covered in [[basic pulley motion]] but look at the diagram and picture what happens... the motion of $\Delta s_{B} = \frac{1}{2} \Delta s_{A}$, this comes because we have a different equation govening the cord length distrobution:

> ### $$ 2s_{B} + s_{A} + h  = l_{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $l_{T}=$ total cord length 
>> $l_{CD}=$ cord length over pullys
>> $s_{A},s_{B}=$ cords on each side of the pully

Which is distincly different to the [[basic pulley motion#^f9b477|simular equation taken from basic pully motion]].
We can apply the same differentiation process:
$$\begin{align*}
2s_{B} + s_{A} + h  &= l_{T}\\
2 \frac{ds_{B}}{dt} + \frac{ds_{A}}{dt} &= 0\\
\frac{ds_{B}}{dt} &= - \frac{1}{2} \frac{ds_{A}}{dt}\\
|\frac{ds_{B}}{dt}| &=  \frac{1}{2} |-\frac{ds_{A}}{dt}| & \frac{d^{2}s_{B}}{dt^{2}} &= - \frac{1}{2} \frac{d^{2}s_{A}}{dt^{2}} \\
\Delta s_{B} &= \frac{1}{2} \Delta s_{A}& m\frac{d^{2}s_{B}}{dt^{2}} &= - m\frac{1}{2} \frac{d^{2}s_{A}}{dt^{2}}\\
&& F_{B} &= - \frac{1}{2} F_{A}
\end{align*}$$

This can be used in the same way as gears to change the magnitude of output from the input (of course this isn't some [[free energy machine]], the work is the same, which correlates to the changed distance moved between the input and output). This is highly [[incredibly based might I add|based]].

There is nothing stopping you getting a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 ect, you could even have a ratio of like 2:3 go wild:

Here's a 5:1, meaning this 100kg create full of [[crack]] can be easily lifted by [[relateable|even someone as weak and pathetic]] as you!
