#### Describe
## Basic pulley motion
![[Pasted image 20220110211408.png]]
> ### $$ s_{A} + s_{B} + l_{CD} = l_{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $l_{T}=$ total cord length 
>> $l_{CD}=$ cord length over pully (sometimes approximated to zero)
>> $s_{A},s_{B}=$ cords on each side of the pully

This equation is quite obvious but it effectively descibes the range of motion of A and B along with how their positions relate to eachother when the cords in tension.
