#### Describe
## Basic pulley motion

> ### $$ s_{A} + s_{B} + l_{CD} = l_{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $l_{T}=$ total cord length 
>> $l_{CD}=$ cord length over pully (sometimes approximated to zero)
>> $s_{A},s_{B}=$ cords on each side of the pully

This equation is quite obvious but it effectively descibes the range of motion of A and B along with how their positions relate to eachother when the cords in tension. This does however require the assumption that $l_{T}$ is constant.

If we take the [[differentiation|derivative]] this also leads to:
> ### $$ \frac{ds_{A}}{dt} = - \frac{ds_{B}}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $t=$ time
>> $s_{A},s_{B}=$ cords on each side of the pully
Of course this will also apply to acceleration and further derivatives but you get
