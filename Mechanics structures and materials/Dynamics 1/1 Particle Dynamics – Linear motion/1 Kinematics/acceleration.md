#### Define mathamatically
## Acceleration
We already have [[Speed, velocity and acceleration]], which describes how integration and differentiation can relate the different things, but here we are going to do a more comprehensive description.

> ### $$ a = \frac{dv}{dt} = v \frac{dv}{ds} $$ 
>> where:
>> $a=$ [[acceleration]] as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] 
>> $v=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]] as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $s=$ poition as a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $t=$ time

Note that this will also work if you are using scala
