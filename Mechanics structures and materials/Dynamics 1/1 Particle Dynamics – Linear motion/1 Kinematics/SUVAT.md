Get the stuff from [[using integration to relate velocity, acceleration and position]], and assume a to be constant then you can get these:
> ### $$ v = v_{0} + a_{c} t $$ 
>> where:
>> $v=$ final [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $v_{0}=$ initial [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $a_{c}=$ [[acceleration]]
>> $t=$ time

> ### $$ s = s_{0} + v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2} a_{c} t^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $t=$ time
>> $s=$ final position
>> $s_{0}=$ initial position
>> $v_{0}=$ initial [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $a_{c}=$ [[acceleration]]

> ### $$ v^{2} = v^{2}_{0} + 2a_{c} (s-s_{0}) $$ 
>> where:
>> $s=$ final position
>> $s_{0}=$ initial position
>> $v=$ final [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $v_{0}=$ initial [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
>> $a_{c}=$ [[acceleration]]
