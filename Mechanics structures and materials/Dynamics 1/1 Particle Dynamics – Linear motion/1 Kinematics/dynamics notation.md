#### What is the
## Dynamics notation
### Variable notations

### Dot notation

There is the added bonus that:
> ### $$ \dot{\omega} = \omega \frac{d}{dt} = \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\omega=$ any variable 
>> $t=$ time

What I'm trying to say here is that if your lazy and don't want to write out $\frac{ds}{dt}$ you can write $\dot{s}$ of course you can do multiple dots for [[Higher derivatives|2nd+ order derivatives]]: $\ddot{s},\dddot{s},\ddddot{s}$

### Vectors
I already have basic [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
