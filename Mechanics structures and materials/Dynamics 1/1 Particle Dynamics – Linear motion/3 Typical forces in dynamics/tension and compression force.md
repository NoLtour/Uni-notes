#### Model
## Tension and compression force
### Situations
So there are 2 situations:
- Springs - Can experience both tension and compression
- Ropes - Can only experience tension

We also tend to model ropes as light and inextensible, because [[meh works well enough|lazy]].

### Maeth

> ### $$ F_{e} = k\Delta l = k (l-l_{0}) $$ 
>> where:
>> $F_{e}=$ [[tension and compression force|elastice force]]
>> $k=$ [[spring constant]]
>> $l=$ Deformed length
>> $l_{0}=$ Origional length

As you can see $F_e$ is a function of distance from origional length.
