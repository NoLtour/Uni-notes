#### What is
## Dynamic friction force
Simular to [[static friction force]] except applies to moving objects.

As you can see it's very simular to [[static friction force#^d66e31]] but the coefficient's swapped out and the limit's are removed. The [[dynamic friction force|coefficient of dynamic friction]] $\mu_k$ is generally less that the situations [[static friction force|coefficient of static friction]]:
$$ \mu_{k} < \mu_{s} $$
