#### Model the
## Buoyancy force
Equal to volume of displaced fluid:

> ### $$ F_{B} = \rho_{f} V_{s} g $$ 
>> where:
>> $F_{B}=$ [[buoyancy force]]
>> $\rho_{f}=$ density of fluid displaced
>> $V_{s}=$ volume of fluid displaced
>> $g=$ [[gravitational attraction|acceleration due to gravity]]

Although we use $g$ here, the equation uses any net acceleration force acting on a body. Hence in free fall this force won't apply but in a centriguge you can just use this equation.
Of course it is common to just use $g$ but for aero/astro we may use this equation in more creative ways.
