### Spring constant
Used to define [[tension and compression force|elastice force]] for a given displacement where it is assumed that force is proportional to extention/compression:

> ### $$ F = kx $$ 
>> where:
>> $F=$ Force
>> $k=$ [[spring constant]]
>> $x=$ displacement

There are a bunch of equations defining the [[spring constant]] for lots of different situations: [[equivalent springs]]
