#### What is
## Conservation of momentum
In a [[closed system]] the total momentum remains constant. This applies to all interactions between particles:

> ### $$ \sum\limits I_{1} = \sum\limits I_{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $I_{1}=$ the inititial momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]]
>> $I_{2}=$ the momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]] at some time

When dealing with particles this is easy to apply, but with real world applications momentum can seemingly not be conserved, but in reality it may be lost as heat which is just particle motion on an atomic scale and other simular effects. 

(The lecturer said it doesn't hold for collisions with the ground, which is wrong the ground does accelerate, it's just negligible and is canceled out by your initial acceleration (usually gravity). I know it was probably said because )
