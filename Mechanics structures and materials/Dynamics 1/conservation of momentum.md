#### What is
## Conservation of momentum
In a [[closed system]] the total momentum remains constant. This applies to all interactions between particles:

> ### $$ \sum\limits I_{1} = \sum\limits I_{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $I_{1}=$ the inititial momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]]
>> $I_{2}=$ the momentum of a particle in a [[closed system]] at some time
