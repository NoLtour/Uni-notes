#### Describe and explain the use of a
## Practical real world method for measuring strain

### Intro
So since it's not really practical to measure the stress a structure is experiencing directly (but we still [[so things dont break 4head|kinda need to know it]]) we instead measure strain and then use that to calculate stress.

### Method (strain guage)
Of course we know that $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta x}{x}$ but unless you are just measuring some perfectly uniform beam measuing change in length doesn't really work since it ignores that what really matters are [[local strain|local strains]], so to approximate these we need to use a method that measures tiny changes over tiny distances. Considering with most structures strain is absolutly fucking tiny your not going to be able to do this with a ruler, so we use based things called [[strain guage|strain guages]]:
