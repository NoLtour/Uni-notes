#### What is the method for
## Measuring shear strain
### Useful bits
So we know that the [[practical real world method for measuring strain]] of using a [[strain guage]] can only measure compression/tension but not torsion. So we use multiple [[strain guage|strain guages]] at different angles and then slap that with some rearranged form of the [[strain transformation for plane stress#^aaf81e]] equation.
