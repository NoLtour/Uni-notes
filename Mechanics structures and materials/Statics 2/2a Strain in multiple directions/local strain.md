#### What is
## Local strain
In real life strains are [[because reasons|never]] constant throughout a shape, sometimes we can approximate them as such and it works well enough, but when that isn't the case we may need to define local strains and have them defined interms of some function or related to some data set to allow for further sufficiently accurate calculation.

This of couse also applies in x,y,z directions. If $du_{x}=0$ it can be that both sides have equal movement and the thing is moving, just something to keep in mind.
