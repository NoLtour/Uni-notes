#### What is a
## Strain field
Unlike stress, we can visually see strain:

If you imagine marking 2 points on some object, you can see how they move to see strain.

A strain field is a way to visualise how strain varies across a shape, this is useful since strain often varies across a shape:

Here you can see how strain varies by the strain field that can be seen due to the drawn lines. Since stress and strain are directly linked, this can also allow us to asses where stress concentrations occur.

Upto now we have focused on approximating strain as a constant across the entire shape, now we are going to start using [[local strain]].
