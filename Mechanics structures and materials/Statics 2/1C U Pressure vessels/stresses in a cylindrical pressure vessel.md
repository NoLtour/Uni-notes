#### How can we calculate
## Stresses in a cylindrical pressure vessel
First we split the cylinder into two halfs:

For equilibrium we know that: $pA_{outside}=\sigma_{yy}A_{inside}$:
$$\begin{align*}
pA_{outside}&=\sigma_{yy}A_{inside}\\
p(2RL) &= \sigma_{yy} (2tL)\\
\frac{p2RL}{2tL} &= \sigma_{yy}\\
\sigma_{yy}&= \frac{pR}{t}
\end{align*}$$

Hence we
