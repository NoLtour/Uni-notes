Had the idea that what actually causes fracture is maximum shear. So going back to [[mohrs circle]] we can find maximum shear and when that reaches a maximum fracture should occur:
![[points of intrest on mohrs circle#^765894]]

But to apply this in 3D we will need to apply [[mohrs circle]] to the other 2 planes as well to get
