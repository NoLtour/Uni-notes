#### What is
## Von mises yield criterion
### Intro
It is the more ((((([[the other one is bad|based]]))))) version of the bitch ass [[Tersca yield criterion]]. That being the official technical language that is used when comparing the two approaches to finding yield stress.

Note that the [[Tersca yield criterion#^3eb6a8|same restriction applies]].

Read [[#Theory]] before [[#Useful bit]].

Predics that yielding is determined by the absolute maximum shear stress. Basically a root mean square approach.
