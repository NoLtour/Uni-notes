#### What is
## Mohrs circle
### Useful stuff
This is a useful techinque for presenting all the possible shear and normal stresses acting on some [[stress transformation for plane stress|trasformed stress]]. Basically this is the way to comprehend the stresses acting in all directions in a intuitive way. (not using that as a buzzword, I mean it, [[step 1|you'll see]]. This is [[based redpilled ect|acc quite neat]] tbh. ([[next part lol]]) )
