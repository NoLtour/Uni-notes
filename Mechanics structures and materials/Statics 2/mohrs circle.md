#### What is
## Mohrs circle
### Useful stuff
This is a useful techinque for presenting all the possible shear and normal stresses acting on some [[stress transformation for plane stress|trasformed stress]]. Basically this is the way to comprehend the stresses acting in all directions in a intuitive way. (not using that as a buzzword, I mean it, [[step 1|you'll see]]. This is [[based redpilled ect|acc quite neat]] tbh. ([[next part lol]]) )

The following is an equation defining the relationship between the normal and shear stress for any stress transformation:

> ### $$ \left(\sigma_{x`x`} - \frac{\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy}}{2}\right)^{2} + \sigma_{x`y`}^{2} = \left(\frac{\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{yy}}{2}\right)^{2} + \sigma_{xy}^{2} $$ 
> ### $$ \left(\sigma_{x`x`} - \sigma_{average} \right)^{2} + \sigma_{x`y`}^{2} = R $$ 
>> where:
>> $R=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{xx}-\sigma_{yy}}{2}\right)^{2} + \sigma_{xy}^{2}}$ 
>> $\sigma_{average}= \frac{\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy}}{2}$
>> $\sigma_{x`x`}=$ Normal stress at some transformed state
>> $\sigma_{x`y`}=$ Shear stress a

Which when plotted resaults in the following:
