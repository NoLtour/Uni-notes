#### What are the equations for
## Strain transformation for plane stress
So you know what we did for [[stress transformation for plane stress]], this is that, like 1:1, the derivation method is litterally the same so if you want the proof to these just look at [[stress transformation for plane stress#Proof]]:

> ### $$ \varepsilon_{x'x'} = \sigma_{yy} \sin^{2}\theta + \sigma_{xx} \cos^{2}\theta + 2\sigma_{xy}\sin\theta \cos\theta $$ 
> ### $$ \sigma_{x'x'} = \sigma_{yy} \sin^{2}\theta + \sigma_{xx} \cos^{2}\theta + \sigma_{xy} \sin2\theta $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{x'x'}=$ normal stress on slice 
>> $\theta=$ angle of slice
>> $\sigma=$ stresses


> ### $$ \sigma_{x'y'} = (\sigma_{yy} -\sigma_{xx})\cos\theta \sin\theta  + \sigma_{xy}(\cos^{2}\theta- \sin^{2}\theta ) $$ 
> ### $$ \sigma_{x'y'} = (\sigma_{yy} -\sigma_{xx}) \frac{\sin2\theta}{2}  + \sigma_{xy}(\cos^{2}\theta- \sin^{2}\theta ) $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{x'y'}=$ shear stress along slice 
>> $\theta=$ angle of slice
>> $\sigma=$ stresses
