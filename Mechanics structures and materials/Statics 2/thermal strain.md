#### What is
## Thermal strain
Change in dimentions due to change in temerature, where an increase in temp usually resaults in an increase in volume.
It should be noted that since thermal strains are equal in all directions, if a given object has uniform material and uniform temp change then there will be no internal stresses generated (assuming expansion is not hindered).

I prefer to write it this way:

> ### $$ L_{0} = L_{ref}(1+\alpha(T-T_{ref})) $$ 
>> where:
>> $L_{0}=$ current unstrained length 
>> $L_{ref}=$ Original unstrained length
>> $\alpha=$ [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]
>> $T=$ current temp
>> $T_{ref}=$ temperature $L_{ref}$ was taken at

Since it's clearer.
