#### What is
## Shear strain ($\gamma$)
For a square element:

> ### $$ \gamma = \frac{\Delta S}{H_{0}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\gamma=$ [[shear strain]] 
>> $\Delta S=$ Parrallel displacement between sides
>> $H_{0}=$ initial height

Notes:
- For small strains the small angle approximations can be used for $\alpha$
- There is no net change in area due to shear strain, volume is conserved.
