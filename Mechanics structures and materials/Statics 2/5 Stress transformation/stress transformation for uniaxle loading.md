#### Describe
## Stress transformation for uniaxle loading

The important thing to understand about stresses is their values depend on the direction used as axis, for uniaxle loading we only have external forces acting in one direction but we can find the stress at different inclined slices through the object which are also valid interpretations of stress just relative to a different axis.

Heres a diagram represening uniaxial loading and a slice at angle theta through it:

It should now be noted that the total force through this slice will be equal to the forc
