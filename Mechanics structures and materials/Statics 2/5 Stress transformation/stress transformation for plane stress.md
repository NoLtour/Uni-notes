#### Describe
## Stress transformation for plane stress


### Proof
Basically the same as [[stress transformation for uniaxle loading#Proof]] but now in 2D. (so [[something something skill issue|harder]])

Since we have multiple forces acting in each axis we need to account for all their components effect on forces acting on rotated planes:

But we can change our diagram to represent an equivilent pressure in a way that's less overwhelming:

As before we can use pressure times area to get force and then equilibrium conditions to get equation
