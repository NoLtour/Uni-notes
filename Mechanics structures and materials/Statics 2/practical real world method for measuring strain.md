#### Describe and explain the use of a
## Practical real world method for measuring strain

### Intro
So since it's not really practical to measure the stress a structure is experiencing directly (but we still [[so things dont break 4head|kinda need to know it]]) we instead measure strain and then use that to calculate stress.

### Methods
Of course we know that $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta x}{x}$ but unless you are just measuring some perfectly uniform beam measuing change in length doesn't really work since it ignores that what really matters are [[local strain|local strains]]
