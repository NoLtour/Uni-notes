#### Describe the
## Generalised hookes law
Basically eveything on [[plane stress (generalised hookes law)|plane stress]] is just [[generalised hookes law]] with no stress in zz, so this is the more painful version.

Consider this cube:

Now for the cube you can use the following equations for things and stuff:

###

> ### $$ \varepsilon_{xx} = \frac{\sigma_{xx} - \nu(\sigma_{yy} + \sigma_{zz})}{E} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\varepsilon_{xx}=$ strain in xx
>> $\sigma_{xx}=$ stress in xx
>> $\sigma_{zz}=$ stress in yy
>> $\sigma_{yy}=$ stress in zz
>>
