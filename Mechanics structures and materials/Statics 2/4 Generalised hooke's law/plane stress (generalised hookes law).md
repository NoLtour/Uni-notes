#### Describe
## Plane stress (generalised hookes law)
So in the past we discussed [[poisson's ratio]] and we have been mostly solving problems with loads in one diection, but when working in 3D or even 2D there are often stresses and strains being externally applied in multiple directions, so the [[poisson's ratio]] needs to be used to calculate how all these different stresses interact and overlap.
