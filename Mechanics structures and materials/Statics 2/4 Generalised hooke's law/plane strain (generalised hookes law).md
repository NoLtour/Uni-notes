#### What is
## Plane strain (generalised hookes law)
Well we already looked at [[plane stress (generalised hookes law)|plane stress]], so [[plane strain (generalised hookes law)|plane strain]] is just where $\varepsilon_{zz}=0$ (simularly to [[plane stress (generalised hookes law)|plane stress]] it should be noted that this does not mean $\sigma_{zz}=0$). Basically whatever shape we are focusing isn't changing shape in some direction because it's deformation is being impeded.
This can apply in a situation like having a dam, since it cannot expand into the cliffs that it is built against...

Of course z isn't nessisarilly horizontal, you can align the axis however you want since it's just a matter of perspective. Hence it is possible to apply the derived equations in a wide range of situations. They are just forms of [[generalised hookes law]] equations with more constraints:


>> $\varepsilon_{zz}=0$
>> $\varepsilon_{zz}=0$
>> $\varepsilon_{zz}=0$
