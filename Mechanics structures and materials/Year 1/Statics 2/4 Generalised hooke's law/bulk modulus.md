#### What is
## Bulk modulus ($K$)
This is a value used in a form of the [[hydrostatic stress]] equation, it is basically a measure of how a material reacts to being uniformly compressed in all directions:

> ### $$ K = \frac{E}{3(1-2\nu)} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K=$ [[bulk modulus]]
>> $E=$ [[youngs modulus]]
>> $\nu=$ [[poisson's ratio]]

It should be noted that a [[poisson's ratio]] of 0.5 means that there is no relative volume change and the material is incompressible.
