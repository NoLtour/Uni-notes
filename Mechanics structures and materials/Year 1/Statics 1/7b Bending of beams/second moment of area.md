#### What is the
## Second moment of area ($I_{zz}, I$)
Refer to [[moment over a section of beam cross section]] for proof and stuff.

This value is commonly refered to as the second moment of area:

> ### $$ I_{zz}=I = \int \int y^{2} \cdot dy\cdot dz $$ 
>> where:
>> $I_{zz}=$ [[second moment of area]] (around z axis)

>> Note that for this to work the $z$ axis MUST go through the centre of area of the shape, else the [[parallel axis theorem]] must be used!

It is a measure of a cross sections resistance to bending.
