#### How can you find
## Point of highest stress in a beam cross section
(This is for a beam with a __constant cross__ section btw)

It is simply the point with the greatest distance from the [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]] at the point in the beam with the greatest moment:

Using [[engineer's bending theory]].

> ### $$ \sigma_{max} = \left| \frac{M_{max}y_{max}}{I} \right| $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{max} =$ Greatest stress
>> $M_{max}=$ Greatest moment
>> $y_{max}=$ y point with largest magnitude distance from [[neutral surface and neutral axis|neutral axis]]

#### Example

Here $c_1$ is the point which has the greatest stress.
