#### What is
## Stress concentration factor
This is the ratio of the mean [[Stress]] to the max [[Stress]], it is a useful metric for [[Stress distrobution]]
> $$ K_T = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\sigma{mean}}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $K_T=$ Stress concentration factor
>> $\sigma_{max}=$ Max stress
>> $\sigma{mean}=$ Mean stress

If $K_T=1$ then stress is uniformly distrobuted
