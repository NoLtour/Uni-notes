#### What?
## The Macaulary method
The Macaulary method.

### Why we need it

Ok so if we look back at our [[Deflection in beams notes]] and the example that had multiple sections that you had to calculate:
[[examples of calculating deflection of a beam#Example 2]]

You can see things become a massive pain in the ass when this sort of stuff get's introduced, so this [[chad called Macaulary]] realized that we can simplify things with... a method, not sure you know the name, but it is:

### The Macaulary method
![[step function]]

![[differentiation and integration of a step function]]

### Taking the same [[examples of calculating deflection of a beam#Example 2|example]]

#### Implications
This graph suggests that the highest deflection will occur when the load is applied at the centre of the beam
