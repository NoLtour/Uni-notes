#### What are
## Thermosetting polymers
These are [[polymers|polymer]] materials made up of highly [[networked polymers]].

- They cannot be melted for reshaping
- Very dimensionally stable so there is no [[creep (materials)|creep]]
- Generally [[ductility|brittle]] with poor impact properties

The properties make sense when you consider that the entire plastic is basically just one massive molecule.
