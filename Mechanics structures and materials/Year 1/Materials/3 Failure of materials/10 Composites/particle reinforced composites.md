#### What are
## Particle reinforced composites
This is a [[composites|composite]] where your [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]] is a particle embedded in some [[matrix (materials)|matrix]].

As you can imagine these will tend to have uniform properties in all directions.

For example a cemented carbide:

Here the carbide particles give the material extreem hardness, the carbide suffers from being incredibly brittle so the [[matrix (materials)|matrix]] has a (relatively) high [[ductility]] which componsates for that. Producing a [[composites|composite]] that can be used for making very effective cutting tools.
