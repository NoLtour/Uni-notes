#### What is
## Stress intensity factor (Year 1) ($K$)

If we apply a stress over an infinate plate:

We can use a new equation to model it:

> ### $$ \sigma_{local} = \frac{K}{\sqrt{2\pi r}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $r=$ Distance ahead of the crach tip
>> $K=$ [[stress intensity factor (Year 1)]]
>> $\sigma_{local}=$ Stress at the given point

This lets us find the strength of the stress field relative to the crack tip.

Where $K$ can be determined using this equation:

> ### $$ K = \sigma_0 \sqrt{\pi a} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K=$ [[stress intensity factor (Year 1)]] 
>> $\sigma_0=$ stress across the plate
>> $a=$ Radius of the defect

Or in objects that arn't infinate plates:
> ### $$ K = Y \sigma_0 \sqrt{\pi a} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K=$ [[stress intensity factor (Year 1)]] 
>> $\sigma_0=$ stress across the plate
>> $a=$ Radius of the defect
>> $Y=$ A dimensionless parameter which depends on the crack and specimin geometry as well as the mannor of load application

You can also combine these equations:

> ### $$ \sigma_{local} = \sigma_0\sqrt\frac{ { a}}{{2 r}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{local}=$ Stress at the given point
>> $\sigma_0=$ stress across the plate
>> $a=$ Radius of the defect
>> $r=$ Distance ahead of the crach tip
