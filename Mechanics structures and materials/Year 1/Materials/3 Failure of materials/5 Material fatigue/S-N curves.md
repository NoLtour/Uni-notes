#### What are
## S-N curves
### Introduction

These are diagrams used to characterise the [[material fatigue]] preformance of a material. The cyclic stress is often plotted against cycles to failure.

Also note that [[S-N curves]] are not very accurate so should not be used for determining the safe life of structures. They are more a way of displaying the general behiaviour of a given material under specific conditions

#### Loading conditions
S-N curves are representations of the [[fatigue life (material fatigue)|fatigue life]] for a given sample under cyclic loading in the following format:

As you can see the loading follows a sine wave.

#### Notable features
- [[fatigue life (material fatigue)]]
- [[fatigue strength (material fatigue)]]
- [[fatigue limit (material fatigue)]]
