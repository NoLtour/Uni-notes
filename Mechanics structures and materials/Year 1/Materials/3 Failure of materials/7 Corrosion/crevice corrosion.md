#### What is
## Crevice corrosion
### Description
Crevice corrosion refers to corrosion occurring in confined spaces to which the access of the working fluid from the environment is limited.

Basically crevice corrosion is when a crevice within a structure has the right conditions for it's composition to be different enough to allow for localized corrosion to occur.

For example if the gap leading into the confined space is too small for oxygen to diffuse efficiently the conditions within that space could become anaerobic, this then leads to localized corrosion.

Crevice corrosion is a real bitch, because it occurs in places not visible inside cracks and expands them. 

### Factors

- Often linked to assembly, like a bolted structire creates perfect conditions for crevice corrosion to occur in bolt holes
- Debree accumulation can trap oxygen leading to a difference in oxygen concentration which causes it (hence keep thing's clean)
- Overall geometry of the part could have some small hollow regions in which this could occur
