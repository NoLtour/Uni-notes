#### What is
## Intergranular corrosion
### Definition
This is when you get [[corrosion]] preferentially occurring along [[crystal grain boundary]]s.

### Factors

The grain boundary may act as the anode and the grain as a cathode, then of course they are in contact so a electro potential forms and you get corrosion:

In the specific case of a stainless steel, you may weld it and allow it to naturally (slowly) cool from it's high temperature... this leads to the chromium (which is what protects the steel from corrosion) form [[carbides]] which precipitate along the grain boundaries. Now along the grain boundaries you have chromium carbide precipitates surrounded by a region of steel depleted of it's chromium, which results in a electro potential and hence [[intergranular corrosion]]. 
This is why it's generally a bad idea to weld stainless steel, of course to counter this specific example you can put something additional into the steel which preferentially forms (non problematic) carbides instead of the chromium allowing it to be welded. But the main take away is that a) welding is shit b) initiation of corrosion can be really complicated.
(also an additional counter to the steel weld issue is to: reduce carbon in the steel)
