#### What is
## Stress [[corrosion]]
The formation and propagation of cracks (and possible failure) resulting from a combination of corrosion and an applied tensile stress.

As you can imagine, the stress creates cracks then other processes exploit those and then stress helps expand the cracks further leading to highly accelerated crack growth which then also creates more locations where things like normal corrosion or even [[crevice corrosion]]. So you can get 2 processes both acting to accelerate each other (yay).

The lovely thing about these is even if you are well below your [[stress intensity factor|mode I critical stress intensity factor]] (like at 1% of it), it is really horrible for both initiation and acceleration of cracks.
It is of course possible to define a "critical mode I loading stress corrosion cracking intensity factor" $K_{ICSCC}$, below which stress corrosion cracking doesn't occur... but it's gunna be real low.

The good news is that it actually requires specific materials and a specific environment to get [[stress corrosion|stress corrosion cracking]]:

Crack is growing under influence of local stress state and chemical conditions Crack tip chemical state affected by stress state (oxide rupture and reformation)
