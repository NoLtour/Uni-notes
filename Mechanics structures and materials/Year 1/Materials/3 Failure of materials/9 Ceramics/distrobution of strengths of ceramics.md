#### What is/causes the
## Distrobution of strengths of ceramics
The consiquences of [[mechanical properties of ceramics|dislocation motion in ceramics]] being so limited and the subsiquential negligible [[ductility]] leads to cracks having a large effect on the preformance of a [[ceramics|ceramic]]. Then due to the random variation of crack size as a resault of manufacturing there is a large range of strengths for the same type of [[ceramics|ceramic]]:

This makes it hard to predict safe loads, so instead we find the probability of failure at any given stress:

Then make design desisions on an acceptable stress based off the data.
