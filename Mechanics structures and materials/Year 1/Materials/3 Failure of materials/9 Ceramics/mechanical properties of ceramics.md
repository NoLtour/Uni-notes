#### What causes the
## Mechanical properties of ceramics
### Cause
It mostly comes down to how the [[ionic bonding]] impedes [[dislocation motion]]:

If you try to move the ions past eachother they have strong repulsive forces that impede motion, hence the possible dislocation slip systems become very limited.
It should be noted that at high enough temperatures it becomes possible for these layers to slip past eachother.

### Material properties
- Hard and wear resistant due to very strong bonds.
- High chemical resisistance (things like [[oxidation reaction|oxidation]] and [[corrosion]]), most ceramics are already oxides hence they cannot be [[oxidation reaction|oxidised]].
- High shear strength due to strong bonds.
- Very [[ductility|brittle]] so cannot plastically deform to releave [[stress concentration]]s, consiquently flaws have alot of influence on overall material strength.
- Strong in compression but weak in tension (generally about 10x weaker)
