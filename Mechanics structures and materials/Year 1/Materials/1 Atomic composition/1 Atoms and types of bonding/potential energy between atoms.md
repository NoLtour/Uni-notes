#### What's
## potential energy between atoms

Atoms repel and attract each other to a certain extent, but the repulsive and attractive forces have different $\frac{dF}{dx}$ rates which leads to a force distance graph that looks like:

The potential energy graph is also shown, as you can see the greatest potential energy deficit occurs when the force is zero; the fact that there is such a potential energy minimum leads to bonds between atoms existing. 

The specific forces causing the attraction as well as the properties of the atoms (eg: [[electron subshells]]) changes the graphs of the attractive and repulsive interatomic forces which ultimately contributes greatly to differences in material properties.
