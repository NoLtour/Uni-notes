#### What is the
## Dynamics notation
### Variable notations

### Dot notation

There is the added bonus that:
> ### $$ \dot{\omega} = \omega \frac{d}{dt} = \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\omega=$ any variable 
>> $t=$ time

What I'm trying to say here is that if your lazy and don't want to write out $\frac{ds}{dt}$ you can write $\dot{s}$ of course you can do multiple dots for [[Higher derivatives|2nd+ order derivatives]]: $\ddot{s},\dddot{s},\ddddot{s}$

### Vectors
I already have basic [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] description, but there are more ways of representing a vector, for example:

> ### $$ \textbf{x} = \bar{x} = \vec{x} = \underline{x} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{x}=$ a vector

We usually represent [[Scalars and vectors|scalars]] with non special syntaxed symbols for example:
- scalar: $x$ 
- vector: $\textbf{x}$

Though if I'm being honest during long pages of working it's not uncommon to take the cba approach and write a vector using the syntax of a scalar, so watch out for that, because [[I prefer to say efficient|people are lazy]].
