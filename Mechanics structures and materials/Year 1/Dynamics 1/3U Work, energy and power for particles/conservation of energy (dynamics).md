#### What is
## Conservation of energy (dynamics)
The "energy can't be created or destroyed" thing, when you apply this to particles you get:
> ### $$ KE_{1} + V_{g1} + V_{e1} + \sum\limits U_{1\to 2} = KE_{2} + V_{g2} + V_{e2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $KE=$ [[work energy principle|kinetic energy]]
>> $V_{g}=$ [[gravitational attraction|gravitational]] [[conservative force|potential energy]]
>> $V_{e}=$ [[tension and compression force|elastic]] [[conservative force|potential energy]]
>> $U=$ any other work done

Basically the starting point equation you have already been using for ages, just written in a long way...
Of course you can apply conservation of energy to systems of particles:

Here the sum of energy before and after are equal... assuming it's a [[closed system]] with no energy transfers across the [[system boundary]]. (basically you can apply this equation to the thing as a whole and relate the energy states of multiple particles together)
