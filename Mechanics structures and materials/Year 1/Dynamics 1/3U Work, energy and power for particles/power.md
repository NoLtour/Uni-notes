#### What is
## Power ($P$)

The rate of [[work done in dynamics|work done]].

> ### $$ P = \frac{dU}{dt} = \int \underline{F}\cdot\underline{dv} $$ 
>> where:
>> $P=$ [[power]] 
>> $U=$ [[work done in dynamics|work done]]
>> $t=$ time
>> $\underline{F}=$ Force [[Scalars and vectors|vector]]
>> $\underline{v}=$ [[velocity and speed|velocity]]
