## Bending a beam with [[grow up|ass]]ymetric cross sections
 
![[Pasted image 20230219120816.png]]

When a beam is under bending moment $M_{z}$ (parallel to z axis), it deflects in both x-y and x-z planes. This also has the consequence that unlike with symetric beams where max stress occurs at the upper and lower points this may not be the case in a asymmetric beam.

Note: Positive $M_{z}$ creates positive stress in the positive side of the beam in the yz plane. Therefore, the shown $M-z$ above is negative. ([[deformation due to bending in beams|notation for moments on a beam]])
