## Comparison of axial and shear stress

When designing structures the main thing that matters is max stress, so here's the question what's higher shear stress or axial stress?

From [[engineer's bending theory]] we know that max axial stress occurs at $\sigma_{xx,max}= \frac{M_{zz}y_{max}}{I_{zz}}$ and from [[shear force in a arbitrary symmetric cross section]] we know that
