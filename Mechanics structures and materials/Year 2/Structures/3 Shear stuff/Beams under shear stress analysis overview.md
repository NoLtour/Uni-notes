# Beams under shear stress analysis overview

#### Intro and contents
![[Pasted image 20230226154840.png]]

Recap from last year:
- [[modeling shear stress in beams]]
- [[shear stress in a beam cross section]]

K now moving on from "easy" beams, onto this years content:
- [[shear force in a arbitrary symmetric cross section]]
- [[comparison of axial and shear stress]]
- [[calculating shear stress in open sections]]
- [[shear centre]]

## Expanded articles
