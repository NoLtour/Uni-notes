## Slipband crack formation

This is where stresses on a material cause shear forces on it's [[crystallographic planes|crystal planes]], which intern lead to parallel planes shifting slightly. Over the course of countless cycles these tiny shifts can create significant defects even in materials that originally had a perfect defect free surface:

These defects can be initiation points for cracks. The cycles taken for this to occur is measured using [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]].
