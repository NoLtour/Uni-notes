## Electrolyte concentration effect on electro potential

### Equation

K so we know how to find the [[electrode potential|standard electro potential]], but this [[cringe man chemistry|nerd]] called Nernst figured out that the molar concentration determines the actual electro potential between two materials with the eqaution:

> ### $$\begin{align*} E  &= E_{0} - \frac{5.592}{n} \log C_{ion}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $E=$ concentration specific electro potential for cell
>> $E_{0}=$ [[electrode potential|standard electro potential]] for the cell
>> $n=$ number of electrons transferred (per metal ion)
>> $C_{ion}=$ molar concentration, equal to the concentration of ions outside the cell divide
