## Electrode potential
In electrochemistry, electrode potential is the electromotive force of a galvanic cell built from a standard reference electrode and another electrode to be characterized.

Electrode potential appears at the interface between an electrode and electrolyte due to the transfer of charged stuff across the interface, specific adsorption of ions at the interface, and specific adsorption/orientation of polar molecules, including those of the solvent.

In an electrochemical cell, the [[cathode]] and the [[anode]] have a certain electrode potential independently and the difference between them is the cell potential.
