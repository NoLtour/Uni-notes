## Electrode potential
In the same environment different elements [[oxidation reaction|oxidise]] at different rates. The standard electrode half cell potential gives us a measure of reactivity.

### Example

Here we can calculate the cell potential by taking the most negative minus the least negative material, zinc is the most negative and coppers clearly the least negative so:
