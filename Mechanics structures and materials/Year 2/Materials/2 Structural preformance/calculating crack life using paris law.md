## Calculating crack life using [[AHHHHHHHHHHHHH FRENCH|paris]] law

### Derivation

Starting with [[crack propagation rate (material fatigue)#Crack propigation rate equation (paris rule)|paris rule]]:
$$\frac{da}{dN} = A (\Delta K)^{m}$$
It's obvious that to find $N$ we'll need some integration, further we need a equation for $\Delta K$, K so let's grab the equation for [[stress intensity factor]]:

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta K &= Q \Delta \sigma 
\end{align*}$$
