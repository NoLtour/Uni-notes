## Reducing fatigue

### Factors effecting fatigue strength
There are 5 main ones:
- Macroscopic stress concentrations, think geometry of the structure: narrowings, corners ect.
- Microscopic stress concentrations, [[precipitation (crystals)|precipitation]], cracks, defects.
- [[residual stress|Residual stress]]
- Environmental factors

If your thinking "but you only listed 4", well.... THERE ARE ONLY 4 ON THE SLIDE EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS 5. You will share in the [[having lasted this long on the course we are both quite experienced|mental pain]] this is giving me.
