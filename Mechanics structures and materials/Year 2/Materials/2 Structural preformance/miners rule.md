## Miners rule
### Intro
It's obvious that the super clean sinosodial curves are not representatibe of typical loading conditions, unless we're dealing with some sort of really specific rotating motion thing the stress over time will probably be something like:

Considering all the maths we've done so far only applies to single frequency+amplitude cases it would appear all of the maths was useless.... introducing miners rule (the title, and the thing that solves this issue)!

### Thingy

So miners rule is essentially you look at all the stress states that will occur and use the equations derived so far to calculate what fraction of the design life will be los
