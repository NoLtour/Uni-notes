# Structural performance part 2 overview

#### Intro

The process of fatigue can be broadly broken into 3 stages:
 - Initiation: This is where the crack initially forms, could be due to:
	 - Cyclic loading ([[slipband crack formation]])
	 - Existing [[microscopic defects]] (pretty much existing in all materials from manufacture)
	 - Mesoscopic flaw (scratch, dent or some structural stress concentration)
 - Growth: This is where the crack grows, often this growth occurs under [[crack propagation (material fatigue)|cyclic loading]].
 - Final fracture: Kinda self explanatory, crack to big thing go [[big bad occuring|snap]].

- [[material fatigue]]
- [[fatigue limit (material fatigue)]]
- [[endurance limit]]
- [[high cycle and low cycle fatigue]]
- [[mean stress effect]]
