## Environment effect on fatigue

Basically, recall everything from [[Corrosion notes]] and that basically every single thing in this section is creating a crack initiation site or expanding cracks. So what is the effect on the [[S-N curves|S-N curve]]? The results will shock you:

Real shocker, more chemically reactive environments will completely fuck your material. The specifics vary lots but what needs to be considered is what parts of the material are suseptable to corrosion:
- In composites it may only be one bit of the [[matrix (materials)|matrix]] or [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]]
- Could be the intergranular boundaries have a different material due to [[crystal grain boundary precipitation]]
- Could be the crystal itself is just suseptable
- Some of the little additives ([[alloy]]) could be exposed
