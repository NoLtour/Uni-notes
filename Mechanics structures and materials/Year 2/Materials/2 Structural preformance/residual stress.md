## Residual stress
### What it is
This is where the material in it's rest state already has stress acting through it, basically your constraining the material's expansion without external shite acting on it. Lets say you do this on a bar such that in regions that experience high tension when loaded it's resting state is in compression... then when that same region experiences the load which applies tension it first has to overcome the compression pre loaded before it has any chance of reaching [[yield strength|yield]]. 
Residual stress can only exist non uniformly, since if the whole object was experiencing the same stress passively it would just expand/contract uniformly and nothing would be achieved, this means that it must be used regionally.
Something to note about this is thing's like [[creep (materials)|creep]] can start to have an effect on the material even without external forces.

The purpose of residual stress is basically shifting [[mean stress]] to be smaller to reduce the [[mean stress effect|effect of the mean stress]] on the fatigue of the object.

So this is where you shoot a surface with a ball leading to this (highly localised) compression state, now if you apply tension the pre loaded compression takes up that slack. 

In a real world application, you can usually see shot peening used on turbine blade roots (where turbines often fail due to stress concentration):

Beyond the residual stress you also get [[cold work hardening|work hardening]], also now that I think about it if you work harden a material it would also result in [[residual stress]].
