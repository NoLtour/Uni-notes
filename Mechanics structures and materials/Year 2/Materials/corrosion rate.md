## Corrosion rate

We can actually link corrosion rate directly to current:

> ### $$\begin{align*}  \frac{dm}{dt} &=  kI  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*}  \frac{dm}{dt}/A &= \frac{kI}{A}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\frac{dm}{dt}=$ mass dissolved per second
>> $I=$ current
>> $A=$ effected area
>> $k=$ some constant

So it can be seen that if you decrease the area the mass dissolved will remain the same and you will get [[pitting (corrosion)|pitting]]. This isn't really a proper relationship it's more to highlight the fact that corrosion rate is directly proportional to current density.

NOTE: this is true for general corrosion rates, when considering the effects of [[polarization (corrosion)|polarisation]] and [[passivation]] things get more complex.
