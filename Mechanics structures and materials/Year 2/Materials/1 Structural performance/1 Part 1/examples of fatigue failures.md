## Examples of fatigue failures

### Glasses

This failure was caused by [[material fatigue]], here [[beach marks]] can be clearly seen (common indications of material fatigue) which indicate the propigation of a crack(s) over repeated loading. Everyday objects such as glasses can experience this especially in regions of stress concentration such as the supports. 

By tracking back the benchmarks you can see where the cracks originated and therefor where the structure had significant defects and or some other stress concentration feature. The final fracture region is where the structure no longer can maintain structural integrity and experiences rapid catastrophic [[ayyyyyyyyyyy like you|failure]].

Here it's clear that the geometry is concentrating stress along the bends which is where the split occured.
