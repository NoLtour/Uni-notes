## Examples of fatigue failures

### Glasses

This failure was caused by [[material fatigue]], here [[beach marks]] can be clearly seen (common indications of material fatigue) which indicate the propigation of a crack(s) over repeated loading. Everyday objects such as glasses can experience this especially in regions of stress concentration such as the supports. 

By tracking back the benchmarks you can see where the cracks originated and therefor where the structure had significant defects and or some other stress concentration feature. The final fracture region is where the structure no longer can maintain structural integrity and experiences rapid catastrophic [[ayyyyyyyyyyy like you|failure]].


### Car drive shaft

Here it's clear that the geometry is concentrating stress along the bends which is where the split occured.

### Industrial shaft

1) There are many tiny lines pointing inward ([[ratchet marks]]), these are located at the far end from 3 where sudden catastrophic failure clearly occured so are likely the origin of the failure. This is to be expected when considering where in a rotating rod the stress would be highest (the edges).
2) This is the region where the material fatuge occurs and the cracks propigate
3) Where sudden failure occurs, the roughness is consistent with what is expected in [[Brittle vs ductile failure notes|ductile failure]] where instead of a clean cut you get more ripped stuff. This is to be expected since ductile materials are more likely to fail due to long term material fatigue.
