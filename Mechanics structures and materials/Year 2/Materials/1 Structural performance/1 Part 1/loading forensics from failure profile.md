## Loading forensics from failure profile

![[Pasted image 20230207001511.png]]

Here each row shows: low [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]] case, high [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]] case and then a dagram showing loading conditions that likely caused it.

What I mean by [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]] is the region of material required for operation without experiencing final failure (object is still overall below it's [[ultimate tensile strength]]). We know that the region with the [[beach marks]] is just crack, so it cannot support a tensile load, hence the only part supporting the load is the remaining region. If we know the materials [[ultimate tensile strength]] is something like 9 GPa then by calculating the region over which final failure occured  and multiplying we can get estimations of load. (useful and cook)

If something has a high [[Stress safety factor|safety factor]] then we know that the region where final failure occurred will me a small proportion of the failure surface and vice versa.

From the chart it can be seen that it may be hard to distinguish between uniaxal loading and
