## Beach marks
Beach marks are macroscopic progression marks on a [[Fatigue notes|fatigue]] fracture or stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) surface that indicate successive positions of the advancing crack front. They take the form of crescent-shaped macroscopic marks on fatigue fractures representing positions of the crack propagation, radiating outward from one or more origins.
