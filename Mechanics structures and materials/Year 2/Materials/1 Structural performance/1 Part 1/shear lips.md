## Shear lips
![[llustration-of-the-difference-in-transition-from-tensile-mode-I-crack-to-a-fully-slanted.png]]

A narrow, slanting ridge, nominally about 45° to the surface, along the edge of a fracture of a ductile tensile specimen, the shear lip forms the typical “cup-and-cone” fractures. Shear lips may be present on the edges of some predominantly brittle fractures to form a “picture frame” around the surface of a rectangular part.
