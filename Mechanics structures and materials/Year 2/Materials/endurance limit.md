## Endurance limit

Ok so recall the [[fatigue limit (material fatigue)|fatigue limit]], not all materials have these but often there is a number of cycles that is so large that it's practically the same thing. It's a bit of an arbitrary threshold which is related to the operational requirements of the material but think of it as: "the endurance limit is the maximum stress amplitude below which the [[fatigue life (material fatigue)|cycles to failure]] will not be reached".
