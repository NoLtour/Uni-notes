## Electrochemistry of corrosion

### Galvanic cell

Effectively what happens is we create a cell between the two connected materials ([[electrode potential]]), what is important for corrosion is figuring out which metal will become the [[anode]]. The anode is where material is lost and is also going to be where crack formation occurs.

### Electrochemical considerations

K let's take a closer look at the chemistry going on, take this example where something has caused a slight difference in [[electrode potential]] on a steel wall. The seperation between the anodic and cathodic regions is now leading to the formation of a cell and hence corrosion.

#### Anodic reaction

In this example $\text{Fe}$ is being lost so the anodic half reaction would be:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Fe} &\to \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2 \: \text{e}^{-}
\end{align*}$$
The general form for anodic reaction would be something like:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \text{M} &\to \text{M}^{n+} + n \: \text{e}^{-} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\text{M}=$  The metal element used at the anode
>> $\text{e}^{-}=$ An electron
>> $n=$ the electrons lost by the material ions, determined by [[valence]]

#### Cathodic reaction

This is a bit more complex, the reaction is determined largely by the environment. Electrons get transferred from the solution into the cathodic region resulting in the solutions contents forming the ions.

##### Neutral/basic case
This is what's occuring in the image above, here the water + dissolved oxygen is converted into $\text{OH}^{-}$ ions by loosing electrons to the cathodic bit:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{O}_{2} + 2 \text{H}_{2}\text{O} + 4 \text{e}^{-} &\to 4 \text{OH}^{-}
\end{align*}$$

In the steel example above what would then occur is the $\text{OH}^{-}$ ions would combine with the iron ions to form rust:
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Fe}^{2+} + 2\text{OH}^{-} &\to \text{Fe} (\text{O} \text{H})_{2}
\end{align*}$$
Clearly for this reaction you need dissolved oxygen, so if you have water which is isolated from the atmosphere or is stagnant as to dissolve oxygen slowly then you can prevent/slow rusting.

##### Acid case

Here the mechanism is slightly different the electrons move through the material again but form hydrogen gas from the hydrogen ions from the acid.

$$\begin{align*}
\text{H}^{+} + \text{e}^{-} &= \text{H}
\end{align*}$$
