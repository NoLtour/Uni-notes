## Electrochemistry of corrosion

### Galvanic cell

Effectively what happens is we create a battery between the two connected materials ([[electrode potential]]), what is important for corrosion is figuring out which metal will become the [[anode]]. The anode is where material is lost and is also going to be where crack formation occurs.

### Electrochemical considerations

K let's take a closer look at the chemistry going on, take this example where something has caused a slight difference in
