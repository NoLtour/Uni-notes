## Electrochemistry of corrosion

### Galvanic cell

Effectively what happens is we create a cell between the two connected materials ([[electrode potential]]), what is important for corrosion is figuring out which metal will become the [[anode]]. The anode is where material is lost and is also going to be where crack formation occurs.

### Electrochemical considerations

K let's take a closer look at the chemistry going on, take this example where something has caused a slight difference in [[electrode potential]] on a steel wall. The seperation between the anodic and cathodic regions is now leading to the formation of a cell and hence corrosion.

#### Anodic reaction

In this example $\text{Fe}$ is being lost so the anodic half reaction would be:

$$\begin{align*}
\text{Fe} &\to \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2 \: \text{e}^{-}
\end{align*}$$
The general form for anodic reaction would be something like:

> ### $$\begin{align*} \text{M} &\to \text{M}^{n+} + n \: \text{e}^{-} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\text{M}=$  The metal element used at the anode
>> $\text{e}^{-}=$ An electron
>> $n=$ the electrons lost by the material ions, determined by [[valence]]

#### Cathodic reaction

This is a bit more complex, the reaction is determined largely by the environment. Electrons get transferred from the solution into the cathodic region
