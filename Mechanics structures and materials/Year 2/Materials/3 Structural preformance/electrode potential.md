## Electrode potential
In the same environment different elements [[oxidation reaction|oxidise]] at different rates. The standard electrode half cell potential gives us a measure of reactivity.

> ### $$\begin{align*} E_{0}  &= M_{E_{1}} - M_{E_{2}}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $M_{E_{1}} =$ [[the standard emf series|standard electrode potential]] of most negative material ([[anode]])
>> $M_{E_{2}} =$ [[the standard emf series|standard electrode potential]] of least negative material ([[cathode]])
>> $E_{0}=$ [[electrode potential|standard electro potential]] between materials

### Simple example

Here we can calculate the cell potential by taking the most negative minus the least negative material, zinc is the most negative and coppers clearly the least negative so:

This is assuming standard solution concentration of 1 [[mole|mol]] of zinc to 1 [[mole|mol]] of copper.
