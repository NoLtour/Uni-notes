## Electrolyte concentration effect on electro potential

### Equation

K so we know how to find the [[electrode potential|standard electro potential]], but this [[cringe man chemistry|nerd]] called Nernst figured out that the molar concentration determines the actual electro potential between two materials with the eqaution:

> ### $$\begin{align*} E  &= E_{0} - \frac{5.592}{n} \log C_{ion}  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*}  C_{ion}  &= \frac{\text{ion concentration outside cell}}{\text{ion concentration inside cell}}\end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $E=$ concentration specific electro potential for cell
>> $E_{0}=$ [[electrode potential|standard electro potential]] for the cell
>> $n=$ number of electrons transferred (per metal ion)
>> $C_{ion}=$ molar concentration, equal to the concentration of ions outside the cell divided by concentration of ions inside the cell

The equation shows that if you increase the ion concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the cell then you can greatly accelerate the electro optential and hence the rate of corrosion.

### Effect

Here the waterdrop has oxygen diffusing in from the edges, and the electrochemical reaction is causing the anode to have very low oxygen concentration. The concentration gradient then greatly accelerates the corrosion. This is also why [[pitting (corrosion)|pitting]] is so bad.
