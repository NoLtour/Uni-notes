## High cycle and low cycle fatigue
### Description
These are just classifications for how many cycles it takes for something to break. ([[final fracture (material fatigue)]]) As with most classifications in materials it is arbitrary kek:
- [[high cycle and low cycle fatigue|high cycle fatigue]] where fracture occurs after 10^5 cycles
- [[high cycle and low cycle fatigue|low cycle fatigue]] where fracture occurs before 10^5 cycles

An object like a turbine blads probably going to experience [[high cycle and low cycle fatigue|low cycle fatigue]] while something like a lathe is probably going to experience [[high cycle and low cycle fatigue|high cycle fatigue]].  
Note that on that [[S-N curves|S-N curve]] we used [[stress amplitude]] but depending on what's significant in determining the lifetime a strain curve may be used instead. (strain may be more important than stress depending on object geometry and other [[idk material science seems mostly experimental solutions|shite]])
