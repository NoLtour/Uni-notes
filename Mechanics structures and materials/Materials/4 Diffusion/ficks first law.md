#### What is
## Ficks first law
![[Pasted image 20211031104011.png]]

> $$ \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = \frac{C_A - C_B}{x_A - x_B} $$ 

Ficks law states that the flux (rate of mass transfer)  is proportional to the concentration gradient:

> $$ J = -D \frac{dC}{dx} $$ 
>> where:
>> $J=$ Flux
>> $D=$ Diffusion coefficient
>> $C=$ Concentration
>> $x=$ Distance between points
