#### What is the relationship
## Chain length and polymer strength

We know that in polymers the [[polymer chain length distrobution]] covers a range, but we can get an idea of the overall properties of a [[polymers|polymer]] material based by focusing on the impications of the length of an idividual polymer chain.

Lets consider a incredibly long polymer chain:
- It can get tangled with many other chains over a large area
- This leads to a
