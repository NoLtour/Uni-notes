#### What are
## Elastomers
### Intro
These are lightly cross-linked [[polymers|polymer]] chains, they have a small enough number of cross links such that chains can slide past eachother enabling deformation.

### Net effect on deformation
Since the positions of these chains relative to eachother is lightly pinned by the cross links the overall structure of the polymer shouldn't change from resonable tensions.
