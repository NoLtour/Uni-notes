#### What are
## Elastomers
### Intro
These are lightly cross-linked [[polymers|polymer]] chains, they have a small enough number of cross links such that chains can slide past eachother enabling deformation.

### Deformation
#### Effect of pinning
Since the positions of these chains relative to eachother is lightly pinned by the cross links the overall structure of the polymer shouldn't change from resonable tensions.

Hence the overall structure will be consistant.

#### Spring(ism)
The chains are in their lowest energy state when coiled, hence when tensile forces are removed they will return to a coiled state. 
Hence they make good springs (elastic bands are usually [[elastomers]]).

Also read [[polymers under tension]].
