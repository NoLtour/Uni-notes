#### What is
## Critical stress intensity factor ($K_c$)
The critical stress intensity factor is the [[stress intensity factor]] at which the local stress required for fracture to occur is reached.

> ### $$ K_c = \sigma_f \sqrt{\pi a_c} $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $\sigma_f=$ stress applied at fracture
>> $a_c=$ critical crack radius
