#### What is
## Critical stress intensity factor ($K_c$)
The critical stress intensity factor is the [[stress intensity factor]] at which the local stress required for fracture to occur is reached.

This is the equation for critical stress intensity factor for an infinate plate:

> ### $$ K_c = \sigma_f \sqrt{\pi a_c} $$ 
>> where:
>> $K_c=$ [[critical stress intensity factor]] 
>> $\sigma_f=$ stress applied at fracture
>> $a_c=$ critical crack radius

So if we know either $\sigma$ or $a$ we can determine the other.

This is the equation for the critical stress intensity factor for any shape object

>> $Y=$ A dimensionless parameter which depends on the crack and s
