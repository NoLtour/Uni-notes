#### What is
## Grain boundary strengthening
This is a method for strengthening materials by changing their average crystalline grain size. 
It is based on the fact that it requires very large amounts of energy for [[dislocations]] to travel between grain boundaries, this is because grains are often misaligned and to move between them the dislocation needs to change orientation which requires lots of energy, (unless of course the grains are aligned but this often isn't the case). 
This also leads to the accumulation of dislocations at grain edges.
