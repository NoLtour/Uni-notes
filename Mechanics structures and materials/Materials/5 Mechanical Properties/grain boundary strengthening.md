#### What is
## Grain boundary strengthening
This is a method for strengthening materials by changing their average crystalline grain size. 
It is based on the fact that it requires very large amounts of energy for [[dislocations]] to travel between grain boundaries, this is because grains are often misaligned and to move between them the dislocation needs to change orientation which requires lots of energy, (unless of course the grains are aligned but this often isn't the case). 
This also leads to the accumulation of dislocations at grain edges.

#### Accumulation of deformations at grain boundaries

The accumulation of deformations along grain boundaries causes stress to concentrate on the dislocation nearest to the boundary, once there is enough stress the dislocation has enough energy to move accross the boundary. 
In larger grains this is easyer because the increased size leads to more dislocations, but smaller grains have less dislocations so the accumulation of dislocations is harder; hence why smaller grains tend to have greater strength.

Now you can use [[grain structure control]] to have smaller grains in a material leading to stronger materials.
