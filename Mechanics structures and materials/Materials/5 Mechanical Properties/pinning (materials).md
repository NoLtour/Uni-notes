#### What is
## Pinning (materials)
In a crystalline material, [[dislocations]] can move through the lattice causing plastic deformation. Pinning points in a material inhibit [[dislocation motion]], requireing a greater amount of force to be required to overcome the barrier. This increases the materials strength and [[yield strength|yield point]].
