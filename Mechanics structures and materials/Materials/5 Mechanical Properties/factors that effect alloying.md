2) Crystal structure - If both materials have simular structures then the impurity tends to be more sl
3) Electronegativity - If the difference here is too large you will get a chemical reaction instead. ([[duh idot|which is bad]])
4) [[valence|Valency]] - Metals more easily dissolve into others with higher [[valence|valency]].
