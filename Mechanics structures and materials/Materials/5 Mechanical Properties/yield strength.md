#### What is
## Yield strength
This is the stress at which noticeable plastic deformation occurs.

Generally we define this as where stress inflicts a 0.2% plastic strain. You can see how we calculate plastic strain below, you take a line from the point on your graph parrallel to the elastic region and find where it intercepts the strain axis to get plastic strai

Although we like to think of [[Stress]] [[Strain]] graphs as clean lines, they can be very messy:

The blue graph shows steel, here we use the lower yield point instead of the higher one. As you can see choosing a yield point isn't nessisarily easy.
