#### What is the
## Hall-Petch equation
This is based on [[grain boundary strengthening]], it is the observation that fine grain materialls are stronger (within limits).
> ### $$ \sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k_y d^{-\frac{1}{2}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_y=$  [[yield strength]]
>> $\sigma_0=$ Material specific constant
>> $k_y=$ Material specific constant
>> $d=$ grain size
