#### What is the equation from using the
## Griffith approach for critical stress
#### Equation
Proved in [[Griffith approach]].

> ### $$ \sigma_f = \sqrt\frac{2E\gamma}{\pi a} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_f=$ Critical stress (fracture stress)
>> $E=$ [[youngs modulus]]
>> $\gamma=$ Surface energy per unit area ($J/m^{2}$)
>> $a=$ radius of crack

This equation is true for thin plates in plane stress conditions experiencing no plastic deformation.

#### Implications
- As you increase the crack radius the critical stress that fracture occurs at decreases, so to get a strong material you want minimal defects in it's structure.
- Since this is a predictor of sudden catastrophic failure (like [[brittle material failure appearance|brittle failure]]) we know that where this type of failure occurs is independent of temperature.
