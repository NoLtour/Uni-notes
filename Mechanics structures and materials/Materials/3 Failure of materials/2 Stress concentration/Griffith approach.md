#### What is the
## Griffith approach
This is the work of a mad lad from [[world war one]], basically he took a thermodynamic approach to why the fracture stress of a material and theoretical stress for breaking atomic bonds varied so much.

It works along the lines of:
- Cracks in materials exist due to imperfections during material creation, these cracks reduce the materials strength.
- Cracks have a surface energy, which is the total amount of energy that can be stored within a given crack.
- Cracks have a stored strain energy ($U_E$), which is the total energy of the stress acting through it.

#### Calculating surface energy in a crack
> ### $$ U_S = 4a\gamma $$ 
>> where:
>> $U_S=$ Surface energy
>> $a=$ radius of the crack
>> $\gamma=$ 

#### Calculating strain energy in a crack
> ### $$ U_E = \frac{(\sigma_0)^{2} \pi a^2 }{E} $$ 
>> where:
>> $U_E=$  
>> $=$
>> $=$
