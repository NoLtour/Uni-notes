#### What is the
## Griffith approach
This is the work of a mad lad from [[world war one]], basically he took a thermodynamic approach to why the fracture stress of a material and theoretical stress for breaking atomic bonds varied so much.

It works along the lines of:
- Cracks in materials exist due to imperfections during material creation, these cracks reduce the materials strength.
- Cracks have a surface energy, which is the amount of energy that can be stored within a given crack.
- Cracks have a stored strain energy ($U_E$), which is based on the stress acting through it.
