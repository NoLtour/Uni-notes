#### What is the
## Griffith approach
### Theory
This is the work of a mad lad from [[world war one]], basically he took a thermodynamic approach to why the fracture stress of a material and theoretical stress for breaking atomic bonds varied so much.

It works along the lines of:
- Cracks in materials exist due to imperfections during material creation, these cracks reduce the materials strength.
- Cracks have a surface energy ($U_S$), which is the total amount of energy that can be stored within a given crack. ($U_S$ resists crack growth)
- Cracks have a stored strain energy ($U_E$), which is the total energy of the stress acting through it. ($U_E$ drives crack growth)

Cracks behaviour under expansion:
- When the strain energy is large enough it causes the crack to grow
- Crack growth increases surface energy, allowing it to handle greater strain energys
- Rate of surface energy increase is linear but strain energy is exponenetial
- So at some point crack length increase

### Math time
