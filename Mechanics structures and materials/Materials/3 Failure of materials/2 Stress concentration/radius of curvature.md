#### What is the
## Radius of curvature ($R,\rho$)
This is the reciprocal of the curvature. For a curve, it equals the radius of the circular arc which best approximates the curve at that point.

Larger values mean it's closer to strait line, with an infinate radius of curvature being equivilent to a strait line.

(cool this links between my dynamics and materials content, [[obsidian is quite cool tbh]])

This is a equation that can be used to find the [[radius of curvature]]:
> ### $$ \rho = \frac{\left(1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\left|\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}\right|} $$
