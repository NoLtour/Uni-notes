#### What is the
## Effect of relative ion size in ceramics
### Effect
In [[ceramics]] the [[anions]] are generally larger than the [[cations]]; consider that they are also [[ionic bonding|ionicly bonded]], this means that the most stable configuration will be when the cations and anions are in contact. Hence the relative sizes of these ions have a strong effect on the structure of the [[ceramics|ceramic]].

In this diagram you can see the [[cation-anion radius ratio]] which resaults in each geometry. Note that the coordination number shows how many [[anions]] are in contact with the [[cations|cation]].

![[cation-anion radius ratio#^53a84c]]

As can be seen as the [[cation-anion radius ratio]] approaches 1 the coordination number increases.

### Example resaulting structures
Here a $R_a=0.563$ resaulted in a coordination number of 6, this lead to a [[face centred cubic|FCC]] lattice.

Here a $R_a=0.752$ resalted in a coordiantion number of 6 and a [[simple cubic|SC]] structure.
