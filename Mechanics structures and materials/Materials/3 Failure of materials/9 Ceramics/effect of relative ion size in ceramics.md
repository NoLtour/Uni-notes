#### What is the
## Effect of relative ion size in ceramics
In [[ceramics]] the [[anions]] are generally larger than the [[cations]]; consider that they are also [[ionic bonding|ionicly bonded]], this means that the most stable configuration will be when the cations and anions are in contact. Hence the relative sizes of these ions have a strong effect on the structure of the [[ceramics|ceramic]].

In this diagram you can see the [[cation-anion radius ratio]] which resaults in each geometry.
