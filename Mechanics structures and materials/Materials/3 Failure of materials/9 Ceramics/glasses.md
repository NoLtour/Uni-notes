The right image shows that it is possible to add network modifiers to break up the structure while keeping the charge neutral, this has usefull effects on the glasses behaviour under heat:

It breaks up and weakens the structure leading to a lower melting temperature allowing for the glass to be worked and shaped inside it's working range (the temperature range where the glass acts like a super high viscosity liquid so can be moulded).
