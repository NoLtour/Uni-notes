#### What are
## Ceramics
### Definition
A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials often made by shaping and then firing an inorganic, nonmetallic material.

### Common features
- Mostly [[ionic bonding]] though can have [[covalent bonding]].
- Generally made of a combination of metallic and non metallic elements, where metallic ions are [[cations]] and non metallic ions are [[anions]].
- Generally the [[cations]] will be smaller than the [[anions]] since they have lost there outer [[electron shell]].
- The structure is heavily effected by the realtive sizes of the ions and there charges.

[[Ceramics notes]] contains lots more important intorductory information about ceramics.

### Material properties
- Hard and wear resistant due to very strong bonds.
- High chemical resisistance (things like [[oxidation reaction|oxidation]] and [[corrosion]]), most ceramics are already oxides hence they cannot be [[oxidation reaction|oxidised]].
- High shear strength due to strong bonds.
- Very [[ductility|brittle]] so cannot plastically deform to releave [[stress concentration]]s, consiquently flaws have alot of influence on overall material strength.
- Strong in compression but weak in tension (generally about 10x weaker)
