#### What causes the
## Mechanical properties of ceramics
It mostly comes down to how the [[ionic bonding]] impedes [[dislocation motion]]:

If you try to move the ions past eachother they have strong repulsive forces that impede motion, hence the possible dislocation slip systems become very limited.
It should be noted that at high enough temperatures it becomes possible for these layers to slip past eachother.
