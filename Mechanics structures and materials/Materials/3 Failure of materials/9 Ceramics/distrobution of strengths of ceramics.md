#### What is/causes the
## Distrobution of strengths of ceramics
The consiquences of [[mechanical properties of ceramics|dislocation motion in ceramics]] being so limited and the subsiquential negligible [[ductility]] leads to cracks having a large effect on the preformance of a [[ceramics|ceramic]]. Then due to the random variation of de this leads to a range of strengths for the same type of [[ceramics|ceramic]]:
