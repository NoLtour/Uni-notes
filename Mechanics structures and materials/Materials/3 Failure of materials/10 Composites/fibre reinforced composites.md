#### What are
## Fibre reinforced composites
### Basics
These are [[composites]] that use fibres as [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]].

### Mechanics
#### Graphical analysis

The stress strain relationship of a [[composites|composite]] will generally lie somewhere inbetween the line of the [[matrix (materials)|matrix]] and the [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]].

#### Directional behaviour
As you can imagine the behaviour under stress will vary directionally assuming the threads are aligned in specific directions. If we take the following example we can model it's behaviour under stress:

##### Longitudinal loading
Here if we start by assuming a good interface between the fibre and matrix we can assume that strains are all the same:
$$\begin{align*}
\varepsilon_c &= \varepsilon_m = \varepsilon_f & E &= \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} 
\end{align*}$$
