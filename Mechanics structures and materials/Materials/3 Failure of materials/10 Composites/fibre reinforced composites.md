#### What are
## Fibre reinforced composites
### Basics
These are [[composites]] that use fibres as [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]].

### Mechanics
#### Graphical analysis

The stress strain relationship of a [[composites|composite]] will lie somewhere inbetween the line of the [[matrix (materials)|matrix]] and the [[reinforcement (materials)|reinforcement]]

#### Directional behaviour
As you can imagine the behaviour under stress will vary directionally assuming the threads are aligned in specific directions. In these
