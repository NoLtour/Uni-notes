#### Where is the
## Ductile to brittle transition

### Introduction
We know about:
- [[Griffith approach for critical stress]]
- [[effect of temperature on yield stress]]

So based on this:
- Griffith critical stress is constant
- Yield strength varies with temperature

So clearly at some point the yield stress might intercept the critical stress, at this point the material would have no plastic deformation before fracture making it [[ductility|brittle]]... This is basically the idea behined a [[ductile to brittle transition]].

### Plottin it
Here the dotted line $\sigma_f$ represents the critical stress from the griffith apprach.

As you can see at high temperatures the BCC $\sigma_y$ is below the $sigma_f$ line, so:
- Yield point below fracture point
- Plastic deformation can occur
- Is ductile

Hence you can see why most materials are then brittle at low temperatures! The ductile to brittle transition occurs at this intercept (though possibly a bit in the ductile direction since to be classed as brittle it can be upto 5% plasticly deformed)

#### Energy implications

So if colder matterials are more brittle we can also say they will have lower [[toughness]], since the brittle equivilent of the same material will have a lower ability to absorb energy before fracture.
