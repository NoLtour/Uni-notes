#### Where is the
## Ductile to brittle transition

### Introduction
We know about:
- [[Griffith approach for critical stress]]
- [[effect of temperature on yield stress]]

So based on this:
- 

But since the griffith critical stress is constant but the yield stress varies, at some point the yield stress might intercept the critical stress... This is basically the idea behined a [[ductile to brittle transition]].
