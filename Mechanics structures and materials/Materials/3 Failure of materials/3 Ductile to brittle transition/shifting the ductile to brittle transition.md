#### What are the methods for
## Shifting the [[ductile to brittle transition]]

### Effect of only increasing yield point
There are many methods that increase yield point, but don't effect fracture point:
- [[precipitation hardening]]
- [[cold work hardening|work hardening]]

If we plot this effect on a graph using the same axis from [[ductile to brittle transition#Plottin it]]:

We can see that just increasing the [[yield strength|yield point]] of a material tends to increase it's brittleness across its temperature range.

### Effect of grain refinement
If we look back to the [[Hall-Petch equation]],
