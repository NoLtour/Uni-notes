#### What is
## Toughness
Toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy up to fracture, so it is equivilent to the area under the stress strain curve.

As you can see the area under a brittle matterial tends to be less than a ductile one, hence brittle matterials tend to have less energy absorbtion capacity and hence be less tough.

The toughness of a material can be found using [[impact testing]].
