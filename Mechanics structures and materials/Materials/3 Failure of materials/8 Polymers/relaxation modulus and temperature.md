#### What is the relationship between
## Relaxation modulus and temperature
### Typical behaviour
Generally the [[relaxation modulus]] will decrease with increased temperature, especially in [[thermoplastic]]s:

### Differences between [[polymer crystallinity|semicrystalline polymers]]
Here the green line represents more crystalline polymers while while the red line represents more amorphous polymers:

As you can see a more crystalline polymer has quite consistant behaviour until it reaches its melting point and well... melts ([[what did you expect|I know your shocked]]). Beyond that they are also stiffer at higher temperatures too.

- Glassy - $T<T_g$ hence no molecular sliding
- Leathery - [[viscoelasticity in polymers|viscoelastic]] deformation
- Rubbery - like an
