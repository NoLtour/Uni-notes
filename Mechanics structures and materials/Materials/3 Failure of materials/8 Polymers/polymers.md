#### What are
## Polymers
### Introduction
Polyerms are molecules that consist of many monomers (repeat units):

These polyer chains are often incredibly long and resaulting polymer materials have lots of intresting properties.

### Polymer chain shape
Although polymer chains are often drawn as strait one of their most useful properties is the fact that there bonds can be rotated at a "bond angle", here you can see one that is 109 degrees.

Since each monomer has this degree of rotational freedom these long chains can bend to form a real mess (almost as bad as my [[also known as wired airpods to you degenerates|headphone cable]]s):

As you can imagine these long polymer chains can get tangled with themselfs and surrounding chains.
