#### Describe
## Viscoelasticity in [[polymers]]
As discussed in [[thermoplastic deformation#Necking]] it is possible for polymers to exhibit viscous and eleastic characteristics during deformation. 
This also leads to the material exhibiting time dependent strain, also known as [[creep (materials)|creep]].
