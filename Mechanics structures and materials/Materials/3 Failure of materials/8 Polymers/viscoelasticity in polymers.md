#### Describe
## Viscoelasticity in [[polymers]]
As discussed in [[thermoplastic deformation#Necking]] it is possible for polymers to exhibit viscous and eleastic characteristics during deformation. 
This also leads to the material exhibiting time dependent strain, also known as [[creep (materials)|creep]].

It is possible to express [[creep (materials)|creep]] in polymers mathamatically:
> ### $$ - \frac{d\sigma}{dt} \propto \sigma $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$

> ### $$ \sigma (t) = \sigma_0 e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} $$
> ### $$ \ $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$
