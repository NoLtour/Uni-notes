#### Describe the
## Damping properties of [[polymers]]
### Introduction
This relates back to [[creep (materials)|creep]], especially in polymers there is a lag time between the stress and strain of a material, as discussed previously this can become increasingly complex as we introduce a time dependent modulus ([[relaxation modulus]]). If we start by considering a representiation of this lag graphically:

We can catagorise the difference in [[relaxation modulus]] using the following terms:

(note that load vs time is what is being applied to the different resposnes)

### Catagorisation between polymers
I am Jc I cna toye quite fast but ny accuract decreases iver tune wheb U have ny etes ckised, thiuight I anc quite sure that at a specific piubnt the accuract will reach a minimum that it wont drop velow
