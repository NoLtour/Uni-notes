#### Describe the
## Damping properties of [[polymers]]
This relates back to [[creep (materials)|creep]], especially in polymers there is a lag time between the stress and strain of a material, as discussed previously this can become increasingly complex as we introduce a time dependent modulus ([[relaxation modulus]]). If we start by considering a representiation of this lag graphically:

We can describe the difference in [[relaxation modulus]] using
