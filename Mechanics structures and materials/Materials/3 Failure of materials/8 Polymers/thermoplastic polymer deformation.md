#### Describe
## Thermoplastic [[polymers|polymer]] deformation
### Forces that resist deformation
There are 2 forces that dominate this in polymers:
- Covalent intra-chain bonding, it is the covalent bonds formed between the monomers and is incredibly strong
- [[van der waals force]]s, these are the electrostatic forces caused by the non uniform distrobution of charges, although relatively weak they are stronger at lower temperatures

For [[linear polymers]] or polymers with few links between chains the [[van der waals force]] becomes more relevant, hence temperature has.
