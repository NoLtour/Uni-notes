#### Describe
## Thermoplastic [[polymers|polymer]] deformation
### Forces that resist deformation
There are 2 forces that dominate this in polymers:
- Covalent intra-chain bonding, it is the covalent bonds formed between the monomers and is incredibly strong
- [[van der waals force]]s, these are the electrostatic forces caused by the non uniform distrobution of charges, although relatively weak they are stronger at lower temperatures

For [[linear polymers]] or polymers with few links between chains the [[van der waals force]] becomes more relevant, hence temperature has a greater effect on material properies.

### Behaviour under loads
#### Effect of polymer alighnment
When polymer chains are aligned with eachother there monomers are closer which means that the effect of the [[van der waals force]] is greater leading to a stronger attractive force, on the other hand unaligned chains have a weaker [[van der waals force]] between them.

#### Necking
With the previous fact in mind now consider what happens when we stretch a polymer, it leads to polymer chains aligning increasing the [[van der waals force]] and hence the stress needed to extend them increases... now this also applies to necking:

If we look at this graph we can see at stages 1-2 the chains begin to stretch out then at stage 3 necking begins. 
The narrowed area of the material has highly aligned chains with notably higher stiffness, so as you can see in stages 4-7 instead of the neck narrowing instead nearby material undergoes simular plastic deformation.
This continues until the stress becomes high enough to overcome the increased strength of the narrowed area and fracture occurs.

Note that this won't occur for all polymers, it only occurs in polymers where they gain a sufficient increase in strength from polymer alignment.
