#### Describe
## Thermoplastic [[polymers|polymer]] deformation
### Forces that resist deformation
There are 2 forces that dominate this in polymers:
- Covalent intra-chain bonding, it is the covalent bonds formed between the monomers and is incredibly strong
- [[van der waals force]]s, these are the electrostatic forces caused by the non uniform distrobution of charges, although relatively weak they are stronger at lower temperatures

For [[linear polymers]] or polymers with few links between chains the [[van der waals force]] becomes more relevant, hence temperature has a greater effect on material properies.

### Behaviour under loads
#### Effect of polymer alighnment
When polymer chains are aligned with eachother there monomers are closer which means that the effect of the [[van der waals force]] is greater leading to a stronger attractive force, on the other hand unaligned chains have a weaker [[van der waals force]] between them.

#### Necking
With the previous fact in mind now consider what happens when we stretch a polymer, it leads to polymer chains aligning increasing the [[van der waals force]] and hence the stress needed to extend them increases... now this also applies to necking:
