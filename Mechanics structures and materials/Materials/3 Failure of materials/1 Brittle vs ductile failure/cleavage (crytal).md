#### What is
## Cleavage (crytal)
This is the [[sigma mode|best type of cleavage]].

![[cleavage planes]]

### Intergranular cleavage
If the crack propagates along grain boundaries then we call it intergranular cleavage. This occurs because of there being weakness along grain boundaries possibly due to [[precipitation (crystals)|precipitation]] along boundaries ([[hypoeutectic microstructure development#Outcome A|example]]).

Tends to create a more 3D surface for fractures.

### Transgranular cleavage
If the crack propagates through crystal grains then we call it transgranular cleavage. This occurs along [[cleavage planes]] within the crystal grain where layers of atom's can move more freely.
