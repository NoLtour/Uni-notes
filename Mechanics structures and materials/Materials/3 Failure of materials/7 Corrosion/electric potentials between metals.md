#### What causes
## Electric potentials between metals
### Intro
When two different metals are placed in an electrolite there is a [[potential difference]] between them:

This leads to one of them becoming a [[cathode]] and one becomeing an [[anode]], then ions get transfered between them leading to one gaining material while the other looses material.
