#### What is
## Stress [[corrosion]]
The formation and propagation of cracks (and possible failure) resulting from a combination of corrosion and an applied tensile stress.

As you can imagine, the stress creates cracks then other processes exploit those and then stress helps expand the cracks further leading to highly accelerated crack growth.
