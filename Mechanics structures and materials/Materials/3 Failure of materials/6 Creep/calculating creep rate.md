#### Whats the method for
## Calculating [[creep (materials)|creep]] rate ($\dot{\epsilon}$)
We know creep is a diffusion based mechanism so we can use [[temperatures effect on diffusion|diffusion equations to model it]]

>> $Q_c=$ activation energy for creep
>> $T=$ temperature
>> $n=$ the stress exponent, it is dependent on the mechanism
>> $K_2=$ a material constant
>> $R_u=$ [[universal gas constant]] (I think)

Note that $n$ is basically determined by the type of diffusion eg:
- Stress-induced vacancy diffusion, grain boundary diffusion, dislocation motion, grain boundary sliding 
- Mechanisms include bulk diffusion of atoms to relieve stresses, Diffusion to assist Dn. Motion and g.b. diffusion allowing g.b. sliding
