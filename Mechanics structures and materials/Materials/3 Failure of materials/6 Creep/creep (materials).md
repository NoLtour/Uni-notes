#### What is
## Creep (materials)
### Intro
Creep is a [[Diffusion notes|diffusion]] based process that occurs in components that have a constant stress applied to them.
It causes perminant deformation within components.

### Causing creep
#### Stress
For creep to occur there must be a constant stress on the component.

Higher stresses lead to faster creep.

#### Temperature
The component must also be hot enough, for common materials creep can occur at:
- $(0.3 \:to\: 0.4)\cdot T_{melting}$  for metals
- $(0.4 \:to\: 0.5)\cdot T_{melting}$  for ceramics

Higher temperatures lead to faster creep.

#### Notes
- Also occurs in polymers
- It is a diffusion based processes so it can be calculated using [[temperatures effect on diffusion|calculating diffusion]]

### Stages of creep

Creep occurs over 3 stages:
1) Primary stage - The rate of strain decreases, this is due to [[cold work hardening|strain hardening]]
2) Secondary stage - Constant rate of strain, the majority of the components life is spent in the secondary stage
3) Tertiary - The rate of strain increases, this leads to failure and usually [[necking]]



### Example

Here this leadpipe has experienced creep, the constant stress is it's own weight and due to leads low melting temperature warm weather is enough to cause creep.
