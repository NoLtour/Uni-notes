#### What is
## Creep (materials)
### Intro
Creep is a [[Diffusion notes|diffusion]] based process that occurs in components that have a constant stress applied to them.
It causes perminant deformation within components.

### Causing creep
#### Stress
For creep to occur there must be a constant stress on the component.

#### Temperature
The component must also be hot enough, for common materials creep can occur at:
- $(0.3~0.4)\cdot T_{melting}$ for metals

### Example

Here this leadpipe has experienced creep, the constant stress is it's own weight and due to leads low melting temperature warm weather is enough to cause creep.
