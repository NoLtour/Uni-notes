#### What is
## Material fatigue
### Intro
After repeated and unrelenting work being put on the material, stress starts to concentrate due to the accumulation and expansion of defects which leads to it being ripped apart from the inside. [[Never have I related to an inanimate object so much.]]
Atleast [[hahah emmeme|there's memes]], but materials is acctually quite cool tbh.

This is the cause of 90% of metallic failures in real world situations, so yeah. It be big important. (that's the scientific term ofc)

### The cause

Through the lifespan of a component it will often see fluctuating stresses:

The second graph is a more realistic representation of the stress on a real world component.
There are some important values that can be extracted from these graphs that we will use in maths later:
- [[stress range]]
- [[stress amplitude]]

The fluctuating stresses cause defects to initiate and grow until the defect reaches [[critical crack radius]] and fast failure occurs.

#### The steps
There are 3 steps:
1) [[crack initiation (material fatigue)]] 
2) [[crack propagation (material fatigue)]] 
3) [[final fracture (material fatigue)]]
