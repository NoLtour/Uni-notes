#### Describe
## Crack propagation ([[material fatigue]])
Once there are cracks of a great enough size, stress can concentrate around that site when the stresses during cyclic loading are high enough. This causes the expansion of these cracks over time. 

This is the second step of [[material fatigue]].

#### Cycles for crack propogation ($N_p$)
The number of cycles taken to complete crack propagation for specific loading conditions is $N_p$.
