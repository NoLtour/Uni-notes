#### What is
## [[crack propagation (material fatigue)|Crack propagation]] rate (material fatigue) ($\frac{da}{dN}$)

Stuff (yes that is the technical term) often contains defects, so we want to design taking into account [[crack propagation rate (material fatigue)|crack growth rate]] so we can maxamize the lifespan of our construction.

Since [[crack propagation rate (material fatigue)|crack propagation rate]] is the rate of change of crack radius per cycle it is equal to $\frac{da}{dN}$
We also know that the [[stress intensity factor|stress intensity]] will vary at the crack tip since under cyclic loading the stress varies and stress effects [[stress intensity factor|stress intensity]].

We know you can find [[stress intensity factor|stress intensity]] using:
![[stress intensity factor#^bbe7f1]]

So now since we have values of $\sigma_{max}$ and $\sigma_{min}$:
$$\begin{align*}
&& K_{max} &= Y \sigma_{max} \sqrt{\pi a} & K_{min} &= Y \sigma_{min} \sqrt{\pi a}\\
\delt
\end{align*}$$
