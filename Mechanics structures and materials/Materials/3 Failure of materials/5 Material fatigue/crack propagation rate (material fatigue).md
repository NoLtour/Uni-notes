#### What is
## [[crack propagation (material fatigue)|Crack propagation]] rate (material fatigue) ($da/dN$)

Stuff (yes that is the technical term) often contains defects, so we want to design taking into account [[crack propagation rate (material fatigue)|crack growth rate]] so we can maxamize the lifespan of our construction.

Since [[crack propagation rate (material fatigue)|crack propagation rate]] is the rate of change
