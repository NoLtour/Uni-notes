#### Describe
## Final fracture (material fatigue)



#### Fatigue life ($N_f$)
Fatigue life is a measure of the total cycles needed before fast fracture to occur during [[material fatigue]].

> ### $$ N_f = N_i + N_p $$ 
>> where:
>> $N_f=$ [[final fracture (material fatigue)|fatigue life]]
>> $N_i=$ [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]]
>> $N_p=$ [[crack propagation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack propagation]]

Since final fracture occurs so rapidly, it dosn't contribute to the number of cycles before fracture enough to be of any note.
