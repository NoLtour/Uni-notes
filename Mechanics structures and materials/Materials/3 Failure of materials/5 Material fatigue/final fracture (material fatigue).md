#### Describe
## Final fracture ([[material fatigue]])

This is the last step in [[material fatigue]], it is where the cracks have grown past their [[critical crack radius]] and so they expand rapidly under cyclic loading and you get fast fracture.

The cycles after which final fracture occurs is [[fatigue life (material fatigue)]].
