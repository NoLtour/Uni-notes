#### What are the
## Factors that effect [[fatigue life (material fatigue)|fatigue life]]

- Surface finish, rough surfaces have more stress condentration points decreasing [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]].
- Design, sharp corners create stress concentration points which decrease [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]].
- Surface treatements, things like [[case hardening]] can increase [[crack initiation (material fatigue)|cycles for crack initiation]].

You can see this represented on a [[S-N curves|S-N curve]]:
