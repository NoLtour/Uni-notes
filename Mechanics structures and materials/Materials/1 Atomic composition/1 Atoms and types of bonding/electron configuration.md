#### What is
## Electron configuration
This is the distorbution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. Electron configurations describe each electron as moving independently in an orbital.


### Example & explenation
An example of an electron configuration:
(neon) $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}$

Each component of the electon configuration has numbers and a letter which describes that [[electron shell]] and [[electron subshells]] composition, we can elaborate by looking at the meaning of $1s^{2}$:
- The $1$ describes which [[electron shell]] the [[electron subshells]] located in
- The $s$ describes the [[electron subshells#subshell lablel|subshell lablel]]
- the $^2$ describes the number of electrons in the [[electron subshells|electron subshell]]

Since the know the max electrons of the subshell from the subshell label, you can compare that with the number of electrons in that subshell to figure out if the subshell is complete or not. In this example $1s^{2}$, you know that the subshell is full.
