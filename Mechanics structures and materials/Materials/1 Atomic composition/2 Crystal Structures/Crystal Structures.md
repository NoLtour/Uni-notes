# Crystal Structures

Solids can be [[crystalline materials]] or [[non-crystalline materials]].

![[crystalline materials|crystalline material]]

#### Unit cell
These are important, as they help simplify analysis of materials.

### Building solids
There are 2 stacking sequence's we will focus on for now:

1) ![[ABABAB stacking sequence]]
2) ![[ABCABC stacking sequence]]

### Important packing types
These are 3 important packing types:

1) ![[face centred cubic]]
2) ![[body centred cubic]]
3) ![[hexagonal close packing]]

### Polymophism

![[polymorphism (materials science)]]


### Unit cell dimensions
