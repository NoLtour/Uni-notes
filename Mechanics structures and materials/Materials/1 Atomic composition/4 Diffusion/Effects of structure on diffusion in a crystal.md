#### What are the
## Effects of structure on diffusion in a crystal
Firstly you can look at [[modeling diffusion]] to get the effects of temperature and distance but formations within the structure of a crystal can effect diffusion rate, but the structure itself has an important role and causes the following effects:
- Vacancy diffusion - This occurs through the bulk of the material, it has a very high activation energy making rate of diffusion very low. It is directly limited by the number of vacancies.
- Grain boundary diffusion - This occurs in [[polycrystalline]] materials, due to the gaps that form in the boundarys between crystals there are lots of vanancies in which [[vacancy diffusion]] is greatly accelerated.

The take away here is a crystal with a low density and lots of internal space has more internal diffusion.
