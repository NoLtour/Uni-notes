#### What is
## Temperatures effect on diffusion
Diffusion coefficients vary with temperature according to:

> ### $$ D = D_0 e^{- \frac{Q}{RT}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $D=$ Diffusion coefficient 
>> $D_0=$ Diffusion constant 
>> $Q=$activation energy (energy barrier for diffusion process)
>> $R=$Gas constant
>> $T=$Absolute temerature
