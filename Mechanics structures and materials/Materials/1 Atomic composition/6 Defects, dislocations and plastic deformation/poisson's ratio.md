#### What is
## Poisson's ratio ($\nu$)
This is a measure of the [[poisson effect]], it is the ratio of the lateral and axial strains:

> $$ \nu = -\frac{\epsilon_x}{\epsilon_z} = -\frac{\epsilon_y}{\epsilon_z} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\epsilon_x=$ axial strain
>> $\epsilon_z=$ lateral strain
>> $\epsilon_y=$ axial strain

Basically it measures how much the material will contract given an elongation, most materials have a possions ratio between 0 and 0.5.
