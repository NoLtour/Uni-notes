# Mechanical Properties notes

We have already looked at [[Stress and Strain]], but in reality there are 2 methods of modelling it:
- ![[engineering stress and strain]]
- ![[true stress and strain]]

![[atomic effect of deformation]]

![[poisson's ratio]]

![[yield strength]]

![[effect of temperature on yield stress]]

![[ultimate tensile strength]]

![[ductility]]
