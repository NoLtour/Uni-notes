#### What is
## Mechanical twinning
![[Pasted image 20211031123651.png]]

This is where you have homogeneous shear of planes of atoms. The stress required for twinning is generally greater than in [[edge dislocation]] and [[screw dislocation]] but stress required isn't effected much by temperature. Twinning generally occurs in [[body centred cubic|BCC]] and [[hexagonal close packing|HCP]] metals but rarely in [[face centred cubic|FCC]] metals.
