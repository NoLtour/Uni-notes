They can be:
- Self-Interstitial atoms, basically an atom from the lattice that is in the wrong place
- Vacancies, the absence of a needed atom
- Interstitial atoms, impurity atoms in intersistial sites
- Substitutional atoms, impurity atoms substituting for normal atoms in the lattice

As you can see, these would often cause the lattice to be expanded or contracted in a specific area, which change
