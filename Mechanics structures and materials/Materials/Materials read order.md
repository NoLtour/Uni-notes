#### Learning goals
- See why nature just dosn't want us to have nice things
- See how nature goes about screwing us
- See how we use those processes to our advantage
- Build cool stuff inspite of the [[corrosion|insane amount of processes that want to destroy our stuff,]] which just makes it even more of a triamph over the natural world
- See that material science is actually insanely interesting
