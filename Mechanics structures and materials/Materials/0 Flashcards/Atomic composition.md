# 1

What is ionic bonding
#card
This is where electrons are transferred between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

What is covalent bonding
#card
Covalent bonding is when the atoms share electrons in their outer electron shell.

Metallic bonding
#card
Here electrons are shared between atoms but delocalised over a large distance.

what are Polarised atoms
#card
- These are atoms which have asymmetric charge, being more positive on one side and negative on the other; this is caused by the position of electrons in the atom.
- How easily an atom can be polarized is effected by its [[atomic polarizability]].

Describe the force and potential energy graphs between atoms and the consequences of that interms of bonding
#card
Atoms repel and attract each other to a certain extent, but the repulsive and attractive forces have different $\frac{dF}{dx}$ rates which leads to a force distance graph that looks like:
![[Pasted image 20211023162428.png]]
The potential energy graph is also shown, as you can see the greatest potential energy deficit occurs when the force is zero; the fact that there is such a potential energy minimum leads to bonds between atoms existing. 
The specific forces causing the attraction as well as the properties of the atoms (eg: [[electron subshells]]) changes the graphs of the attractive and repulsive interatomic forces which ultimately contributes greatly to differences in material properties.

Describe and explain the 2 types of secondary bonding
#card
- [[fluctuation induced dipoles]], These are when atoms become [[polarised atoms]] and exert [[van der waals force]] on nearby atoms. They often become polarised due to the influence of nearby charges or just randomly due to the random position of internal electrons.
- [[polar molecule induced dipoles]], These are when molecules become polarised, either as a consequence of the [[van der waals force]] or due to [[covalent bonding]] leading to a polarised molecule.

What is valence (materials science/chemistry)
#card
The valence of an atom of an element is a measure of it's capacity to combine with other atoms when forming compounds or molecules. It is measured by the number of bonds the atom in the compound forms.
The modern definition: "Valence is the number of hydrogen atoms that may combine with an atom of the element under consideration."

What is the [[van der waals force]]
#card
This is basically just the name of the force caused by the fluctuation of polarizations of nearby particles. (eg/ [[polarised atoms]])
Note that van der waals forces are seperate things from covalent and ionic bonding.

# 2

Describe the ABABAB stacking sequence
#card
This is when atoms are stacked in 2 repeating layers, on top of each other. This is the stacking sequence for [[hexagonal close packing]] and [[body centred cubic]].

Describe the ABCABABC stacking sequence
#card
This is when atoms are stacked in 3 repeating layers, on top of each other. This is the stacking sequence for [[face centred cubic]].

Describe the general properties of a body centred cubic packing arrangement
#card
- Highly symmetrical
- [[ABABAB stacking sequence]]
- Has no close packed planes
- Has close packed directions (as can be seen along the blue arrows)

What is a crystal unit cell
#card
This is the minimum number of atoms needed to represent the pattern in a [[crystalline materials|crystalline material]], they are the building blocks of [[crystalline materials|crystalline materials]].
![[Pasted image 20211023224027.png]]
Here the highlighted bits are the unit cells.

Describe the general properties of a face centred cubic packing arrangement
#card
This is a packing type where each atom is in contact with 12 others in the following arrangement
![[Pasted image 20211023231850.png]]
- Highly symmetrical
- Has close packed planes (and subsequently many close packed directions)
- Is a [[ABCABC stacking sequence]]
^1651671966942

Describe the general properties of hexagonal close packing arrangement
#card

This is a [[ABABAB stacking sequence]], where atoms are packed in the following way:
![[Pasted image 20211023230854.png]]
- Highly symmetrical
- Has close packed planes (and subsequently many close packed directions)
- Is a [[ABABAB stacking sequence]]
- It is the smallest repeatable unit of the [[ABABAB stacking sequence]].

Why is polymorphism important in materials science
#card
Polymorphism is when materials can have more than one crystal structure, differences between its structures and the conditions needed to initiate a shift between them can lead to problematic effects or useful effects. 
For example, tin transforms from body centred tetragonal to a diamond style structure at 13.2C, but this causes a 27% volume increase which leads to tin shredding itself as it expands causing lots of problems.

What's the method for calculating unit cell dimensions?
#card
Get a diagram of the [[crystal unit cell]] and calculate a (width) as a function of R (sphere radius). Eg:
![[Pasted image 20211023233441.png]]
$$\begin{align*}
a^{2}+a^{2}&=(4R)^{2}\\
a&=R2\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}$$

# 3

what are crystallographic directions
#card
These are geometric lines linking nodes (atoms/ions/molecules) within a [[crystalline materials|crystalline material]]/[[Crystal Structures|crystal structure]]. They are used to denote direction within structures.
![[Pasted image 20211024102311.png]]
The red lines show crystal directions, of course different [[Crystal Structures]] have different crystal directions. They are represented using 3 digit codes such as \[102\], \[-103\] ect.
