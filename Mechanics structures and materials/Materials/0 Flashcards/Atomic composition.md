#card
This is where electrons are transferred between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

what are Fluctuation induced dipoles
#card
- These are when atoms become [[polarised atoms]] and exert [[van der waals force]] on nearby atoms. 
- Fluctuation induced dipoles can dissipate back into normal [[nonpolarized atoms]] due to electron diffusion.
- It should also be noted that the concequential [[van der waals force]] excerted on nearby atoms leads to the creation [[polar molecule induced dipoles]].
