What is ionic bonding
#card
This is where electrons are transferred between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

What is covalent bonding
#card
Covalent bonding is when the atoms share electrons in their outer electron shell.

Metallic bonding
#card
Here electrons are shared between atoms but delocalised over a large distance.

what are Polarised atoms
#card
- These are atoms which have asymmetric charge, being more positive on one side and negative on the other; this is caused by the position of electrons in the atom.
- How easily an atom can be polarized is effected by its [[atomic polarizability]].


Describe the force and potential energy graphs between atoms and the consequences of that interms of bonding
#card
Atoms repel and attract each other to a certain extent, but the repulsive and attractive forces have different $\frac{dF}{dx}$ rates which leads to a force distance graph that looks like:

The potential energy graph is also shown, as you can see the greatest potential energy deficit occurs when the force is zero; the fact that there is such a potential energy minimum leads to bonds between atoms existing. 
The specific forces causing the attraction as well as the properties of the atoms (eg: [[electron subshells]]) changes the graphs of the attractive and repulsive interatomic forces which ultimately contributes greatly to differences in material properties.

Describe and explain the 2 types of secondary bonding
#card
- [[fluctuation induced dipoles]], These are when atoms become [[polarised atoms]] and exert [[van der waals force]] on nearby atoms. They often become polarised due to the influence of nearby charges or just randomly due to the random position of internal electrons.
- [[polar molecule induced dipoles]], These are when molecules become polarised, either as a consequence of the [[van der waals force]] or due to
