# 1

What is ionic bonding
#card
This is where electrons are transferred between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

What is covalent bonding
#card
Covalent bonding is when the atoms share electrons in their outer electron shell.

Metallic bonding
#card
Here electrons are shared between atoms but delocalised over a large distance.

what are Polarised atoms
#card
- These are atoms which have asymmetric charge, being more positive on one side and negative on the other; this is caused by the position of electrons in the atom.
- How easily an atom can be polarized is effected by its [[atomic polarizability]].

Describe the force and potential energy graphs between atoms and the consequences of that interms of bonding
#card
Atoms repel and attract each other to a certain extent, but the repulsive and attractive forces have different $\frac{dF}{dx}$ rates which leads to a force distance graph that looks like:
![[Pasted image 20211023162428.png]]
The potential energy graph is also shown, as you can see the greatest potential energy deficit occurs when the force is zero; the fact that there is such a potential energy minimum leads to bonds between atoms existing. 
The specific forces causing the attraction as well as the properties of the atoms (eg: [[electron subshells]]) changes the graphs of the attractive and repulsive interatomic forces which ultimately contributes greatly to differences in material properties.

Describe and explain the 2 types of secondary bonding
#card
- [[fluctuation induced dipoles]], These are when atoms become [[polarised atoms]] and exert [[van der waals force]] on nearby atoms. They often become polarised due to the influence of nearby charges or just randomly due to the random position of internal electrons.
- [[polar molecule induced dipoles]], These are when molecules become polarised, either as a consequence of the [[van der waals force]] or due to [[covalent bonding]] leading to a polarised molecule.

What is valence (materials science/chemistry)
#card
The valence of an atom of an element is a measure of it's capacity to combine with other atoms when forming compounds or molecules. It is measured by the number of bonds the atom in the compound forms.
The modern definition: "Valence is the number of hydrogen atoms that may combine with an atom of the element under consideration."
^1651670582683

What is the [[van der waals force]]
#card
This is basically just the name of the force caused by the fluctuation of polarizations of nearby particles. (eg/ [[polarised atoms]])
Note that van der waals forces are seperate things from covalent and ionic bonding.

![[Pasted image 20211023232117.png]]
^1651671966931

What is a crystal unit cell
#card
This is the minimum number of atoms needed to represent the pattern in a [[crystalline materials|crystalline material]], they are the building blocks of [[crystalline materials|crystalline materials]].
![[Pasted image 20211023224027.png]]
Here the highlighted bits are the unit cells.
^1651671966936

![[Pasted image 20211023230854.png]]
- Highly symmetrical
- Has close packed planes (and subsequently many close packed directions)
- Is a [[ABABAB stacking sequence]]
- It is the smallest repeatable unit of the [[ABABAB stacking sequence]].

Why is polymorphism important in materials science
#card
Polymorphism is when materials can have more than one crystal structure, differences between its structures and the conditions needed to initiate a shift between them can lead to problematic effects or useful effects. 
For example, tin transforms from body centred tetragonal to a diamond style structure at 13.2C, but this causes a 27% volume increase which leads to tin shredding itself as it expands causing lots of problems.
^1651671966953

What's the method for calculating unit cell dimensions?
#card
Get a diagram of the [[crystal unit cell]] and calculate a (width) as a function of R (sphere radius). Eg:
![[Pasted image 20211023233441.png]]
$$\begin{align*}
a^{2}+a^{2}&=(4R)^{2}\\
a&=R2\sqrt{2}
\end{align*}$$

what are crystallographic directions
#card
These are geometric lines linking nodes (atoms/ions/molecules) within a [[crystalline materials|crystalline material]]/[[Crystal Structures|crystal structure]]. They are used to denote direction within structures.
![[Pasted image 20211024102311.png]]
The red lines show crystal directions, of course different [[Crystal Structures]] have different crystal directions. They are represented using 3 digit codes such as \[102\].
^1651673130159

what are crystallographic planes
#card
These are geometric planes linking nodes (atoms/ions/molecules) within a crystalline material/crystal structure.
![[Pasted image 20211024102311.png]]
The blue planes show crystal planes, of course different [[Crystal Structures]] have different crystal planes. They are represented using 3 digit codes such as \[102\].
^1651673130166

Describe the properties monocrystalline material.
#card
This is when a crystalline material is composed of a single crystal; the entire sample is continuous and unbroken all the way to its edges meaning it has no grain boundaries.
It is anisotropic, so it has different properties in different directions/planes. This can lead to it have large differences in things like youngs modulus and ultimate tensile strength in different directions along the crystal.
^1651673130171

Describe the properties polycrystalline material.
#card
This is when a crystalline material is composed of many smaller crystals, each with a different alignment so it has many internal grain boundaries. For most instances the grains are fine enough that on most scales it can be very accurately approximated as isotropic hence same Youngs modulus in all directions.

How are crystallographic directions represented
#card
They can be represented using the format [XYZ] where:
![[Pasted image 20211024102953.png]]
Note that $\bar{1}$ means $-1$
^1651673130187

What is a general crystallographic direction
#card
These take the format of $<XYZ>$ instead of $[XYZ]$, they are basically a direction that can be rotated 90 degrees around the x,y,z axis' to give other directions.
![[Pasted image 20211024103303.png]]
In this example $[011],[101],[\bar{1}10]$ all have the general direction $<110>$.
^1651673130192


How are crystallographic planes represented
#card
The format is very similar to [[representing crystallographic directions]], except now the values in [XYZ] represent a point along an axis that the plane intercepts:
Here $A=[010]$
![[Pasted image 20211024104217.png]]
Here $B=[020]$
![[Pasted image 20211024104306.png]]
Here $C=[111]$
![[Pasted image 20211024104332.png]]
^1651673130197

What is a general crystallographic plane
#card
They are the plane equivalent of a general crystallographic direction, they take the format $\{XYZ\}$ instead of $[XYZ]$. They are a plane that can be rotated 90 degrees in the x,y,z axis' to give other planes. EG: $\{100\}=[100],[010],[001]\neq[200]\neq[110]$

# IDK
Describe the three main mechanisms of diffusion in crystalline materials
#card
- Self‐diffusion and substitutional solute diffusion - flow of atoms and vacancies
- Interstitial Diffusion - Movement of interstitial atoms from one interstitial site to another
- Other mechanisms involving atom exchange
^1651678316578

Describe vacancy diffusion
#card
Diffusion using substitutional sites (holes where atoms should be), can be self‐diffusion (same atoms as lattice) or substitutional solute diffusion, it is dependent on number of vacancies.
![[Pasted image 20220504162126.png]]
^1651678316585

Describe interstitial diffusion and compare it to vacancy diffusion
#card
Diffusion using small solute atoms using interstitial sites.
![[Pasted image 20220504162250.png]]
There are always lots of interstitial sites so it's much faster than vacancy diffusion.
^1651678316591

Describe "Interdiffusion"/"Impurity Diffusion"
#card
This is diffusion between two solids in a material containing multiple solids, where the solids diffuse along the concentration gradient to create a more consistent solid.
![[Pasted image 20220504162438.png]]
^1651678316595

What is Ficks first law
#card
The Flux (rate of mass transfer) is proportional to the concentration gradient. AKA atoms flow down the concentration gradient (don't need to memorize equation):
> $$ J = -D \frac{dC}{dx} $$ 
>> where:
>> $J=$ Flux (atoms/$m^{2}s$)
>> $D=$ [[temperatures effect on diffusion|Diffusion coefficient]]
>> $C=$ Concentration
>> $x=$ Distance between points
^1651678316600

What is the effect of temperature on diffusion
#card
Diffusion Coefficients vary with Temperature according to an Arrhenius equation:
> ### $$ D = D_0 e^{- \frac{Q}{RT}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $D=$ Diffusion coefficient 
>> $D_0=$ Diffusion constant 
>> $Q=$activation energy (energy barrier for diffusion process)
>> $R=$Gas constant
>> $T=$Absolute temperature
Basically as temperature increases the diffusion rate increases and approaches $D_{0}$.

Compare:
- occurrence location
- effects of material structure 
- activation energy
of vacancy, grain boundary and interstitial diffusion
#card
All forms of diffusion are accelerated in open crystal structures, such as those with low density and low melting points.
Vacancy diffusion:
- occurs though most of the material 
- is slow and limited since it requires vacancies, faster in structures with more vacancies
- requires high activation energy
Grain boundary diffusion:
- occurs along grain boundaries
- faster in structures with lots of amorphous regions
- lower activation energy
Interstitial Diffusion:
- occurs though most of the material 
- not very limited as occurs in the interstitial space between main structure atoms, faster with greater size differences between main and interstitial atoms
- Low activation energy
