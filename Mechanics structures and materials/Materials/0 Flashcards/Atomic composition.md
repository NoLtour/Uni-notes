What is ionic bonding
#card
This is where electrons are transferred between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

Metallic bonding
#card
Here electrons are shared between atoms but delocalised over a large distance.

what are Polarised atoms
#card
These are atoms which have asymetric charge, being more positive on one side and negative on the other; this is caused by the position of electrons in the atom.
How easily an atom can be polarized is effected by its [[atomic polarizability]].
