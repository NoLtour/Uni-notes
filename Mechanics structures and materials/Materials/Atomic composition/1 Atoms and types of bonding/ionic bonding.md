#### What is
## Ionic bonding
This is where electrons are transfered between two atoms, creating 2 charged particles (ions).

#### Example

Na: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{1}$
Cl: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{5}$

The [[electron configuration]] shows that Na has one too many electrons in its outer shell, and the Cl has one too few electrons in its outer shell; so the Na atome gives its electron to the Cl atom.

You can also see that the ions will be attracted to atoms they didn't even share electrons with, this leads to strong bonding forces throughout the compound.
