#### What is
## Covalent bonding
Covalent bonding is when the atoms share electrons in their outer [[electron shell]].

For example $CH_4$ (Methane) has one carbon atom convalently bonded to 4 hydrogen atoms.

If we look at the [[electron configuration]] for each element:
C: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{2}$ it needs 4 more electrons
H: $1s^{1}$ it needs 1 more electron

So the carbon and hydrogen share an outer electron filling their outer shells.
