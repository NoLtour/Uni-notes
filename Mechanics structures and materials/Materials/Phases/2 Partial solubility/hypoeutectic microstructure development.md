#### What are the common forms of
## Hypoeutectic microstructure development
### Crossing at the [[eutectic point]]
![[eutectic point#Effects]]

### Crossing into the mixed material region from a solid region

#### Outcome A
Here you have an initial process identical to [[microstructure formation during equilibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility]], but then you cross into a temperature that is too low for $\beta$ to remain dissolved and so it is pushed out and forms a solid along
