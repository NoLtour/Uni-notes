#### What is
## Partial solubility
### Definition
Consider [[complete solid solubility]], simply put this is not that.

What did you expect more?

A full explenation is [[no really it do be like that|liked here]]

### Phase diagram
![[Pasted image 20211112214718.png]]
Here you have 2 solid solutions $\alpha and\beta$ where:
- $\alpha$ is Ag dissolved in Cu
- $\beta$ is Cu dissolved in Ag

The limits of solubility are:
- $C_{\alpha E }$ limit of Sn in Pb
- $C_{\beta E}$ limit of Pb in Sn

Basically the sections on the diagram that contain $\alpha and\beta$ are the area
