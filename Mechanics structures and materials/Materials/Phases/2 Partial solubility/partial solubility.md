#### What is
## Partial solubility
### Definition
Consider [[complete solid solubility]], simply put this is not that.

What did you expect more?

A full explenation is [[no really it do be like that|liked here]]

### Phase diagram
![[Pasted image 20211112214718.png]]
Here you have 2 solid solutions $\alpha \:and\:\beta$ where:
- $\alpha$ is Ag dissolved in Cu
- $\beta$ is Cu dissolved in Ag

The limits of solubility are:
- $C_{\alpha E }$ limit of Sn in Pb
- $C_{\beta E}$ limit of Pb in Sn

Basically the sections on the diagram that contain $\alpha \:and\:\beta$ are the area's in which a structure simular to the one in [[microstructure formation during equilibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility#^86e2d7|solid solubility]] since no funky precipitates will form in your structure (untill you cross a [[solvus line]])
