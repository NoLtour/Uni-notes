#### What is a
## Phase diagram (introduction)
### Description
A phase diagram is a diagram that shows the composition of a material at a given temperature where:
- The x axis is the composition and the y axis is the temperature.
- It is assumed that there is enough time when moving position on the diagram for everything to alwayse be in equalibrium (basically for a real world change to map accuratly it must occur slowly)
- Lines show seperation between different material states

### Methods of analysis
These are some basic methods useful for gathering information about the state of the material at a point on the phase diagram:
- [[tie-lines]]
- [[lever rule]]

### Example

Here this is a graph of two elements with [[complete solid solubility]], the state is described with labels as well as symbols, the area that contains a mixture of solid ($\alpha$) and liquid ($L$) is labelled $\alpha+L$.
