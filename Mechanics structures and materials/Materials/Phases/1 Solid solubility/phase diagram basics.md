#### What is a
## Phase diagram (introduction)
### Description
A phase diagram is a diagram that shows the composition of a material at a given temperature where:
- The x axis is the composition and the y axis is the temperature.
- It is assumed that there is enough time when moving position on the diagram for everything to alwayse be in equalibrium (basically for a real world change to map accuratly it must occur slowly)
- Lines show seperation between different material states
