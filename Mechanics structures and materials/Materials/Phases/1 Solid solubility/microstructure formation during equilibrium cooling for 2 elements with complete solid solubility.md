#### How do you predict
## Microstructure formation during equilibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility
As alloys cool solids tend to form as dendrites:

### Predicting formation using [[phase diagram basics|phase diagrams]]

You start by drawing a line that describes the change in conditions occuring when forming the material (usually a change in temperature), then you look at how the microscopic structures change under the conditions untill you reach the final conditions and now have your stat
