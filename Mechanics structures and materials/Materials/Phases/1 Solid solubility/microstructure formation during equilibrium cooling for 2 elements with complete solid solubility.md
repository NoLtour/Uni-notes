#### How do you predict
## Microstructure formation during equilibrium cooling for 2 elements with complete solid solubility
#### Useful sidenote
As alloys cool solids tend to form as dendrites:

### Predicting formation using [[phase diagram basics|phase diagrams]]
#### Description
You start by drawing a line that describes the change in conditions occuring when forming the material (usually a change in temperature), then you look at how the microscopic structures change under the conditions untill you reach the final conditions and now have your state defined.

#### Example

Here you start out in the liquid state, and progress downward. You change temperature slow enough that it is alwayse in equalibrium conditions. Initialy you start with [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] occuring then those crystals grow as dendrites, until you reach point d where there is no liquid left and at e it has become a solid crystal.
