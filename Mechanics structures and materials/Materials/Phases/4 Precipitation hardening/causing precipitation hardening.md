#### What is the method for
## Causing precipitation hardening
### Introduction

To cause [[precipitation hardening]] you need to:
- Control the formation of small evenly dispersed precipitates
- Use a 3 stage heat treatment
- [[well shit|Turn's out there is no 3rd bullet point]]

### Requirements
Precipitation strengthening is possible if the line of solid solubility slopes strongly toward the centre of a [[phase diagram basics|phase diagram]]. 

#### Example

The shaded area is where precipitation hardening can be preformed as it is where heat treatment can be used to move between the phases.

### 3 stage heat treatment
1) You start at a desireable temperature in the solid phase
2) You cool the substance incredibly quickly (usually water quenching) so it passes the [[solvus line]] and drops to a temperature too low for internal diffusion
3)
