#### What is the method for
## Causing precipitation hardening
### Introduction

To cause [[precipitation hardening]] you need to:
- Control the formation of small evenly dispersed precipitates
- Use a 3 stage heat treatment
- [[well shit|Turn's out there is no 3rd bullet point]]

### Requirements
Precipitation strengthening is possible if the line of solid solubility slopes strongly toward the centre of a phase diagram. While a large volume of precipitate particles is desirable, a small enough amount of the alloying element should be added that it remains easily soluble at some reasonable annealing temperature.
