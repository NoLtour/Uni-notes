#### What is
## Polymer crystallinity
### Intro
When cooling from a liquid to a solid the polymer can become:
- a crystalline solid, its polymer chains form repeating pattern
- a amorphous solid, it's chains are irregularly structured
- somewhere between the two (semicrystalline), it has areas of both

In reality just about all polymers fall into the 3rd catagory, even then they can get incredibly close to either extreme:

#### Volume properties
More [[crystalline materials|crystalline]] polymers will also have greater densitys:

Since the chains can become more closely packed.

Elaboration on graph symbols:
- ($T_g$) [[glass transition temperature (polymers)]]
- ($T_m$) melting temperature

### Detail on these types
#### Crystalline polymers
The most common formation is a twisted lamellar ribbon structure.
