#### What is
## Polymer crystallinity
### Intro
When cooling from a liquid to a solid the polymer can become:
- a crystalline solid, its polymer chains form repeating pattern
- a amporphous solid, it's chains are irregularly structured
- somewhere between the two, it has areas of both

In reality just about all polymers fall into the 3rd catagory, even then they can get incredibly close to either extreme:
