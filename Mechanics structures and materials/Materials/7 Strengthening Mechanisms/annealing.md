#### What is
## Annealing
This is a heat treatment method that alters the properties of a material to increase [[ductility]], it generally involves heating a material above its [[recrystallisation]] temperature and controlling it's cooling.

There are 3 stages to annealing:
1) Recovery
2) Recrystallisation
3) Further grain growth

### Recovery

Here [[dislocations]] rearrange to minimise local stress fields.
