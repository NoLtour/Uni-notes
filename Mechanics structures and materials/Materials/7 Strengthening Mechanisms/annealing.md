#### What is
## Annealing
This is a heat treatment method that alters the properties of a material to increase [[ductility]], it generally involves heating a material above its [[recrystallisation]] temperature and controlling it's cooling.

There are 3 stages to annealing:
1) Recovery
2) Recrystallisation
3) Further grain growth

[[whatever that means|Prepare for lots of further reading bitch]]

### Recovery

### Recrystallisation

### Grain growth
![[grain growth]]

### Resault of annealing
Since many of the processes that comprise annealing arise from [[Diffusion notes|diffusion]] processes, you can use:
