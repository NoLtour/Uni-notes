#### How is grain structure controlled using
## Nucleation and cooling
![[Pasted image 20211104102322.png]]

You can change how a temperature gradient is applied across a fluid to control the way the crystal forms as it solidifies.

- A [[fine grain structure]] is produced when you cool it down rapidly, this is because the number of [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] events is increased and those crystals don't have sufficiant time to grow, resaulting in many smaller grains forming.
- A [[coarse grain structure]] or [[columnar grain structure]]
