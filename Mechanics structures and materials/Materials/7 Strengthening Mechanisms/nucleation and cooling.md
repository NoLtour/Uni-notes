#### How is grain structure controlled using
## Nucleation and cooling
You can change how a temperature gradient is applied across a fluid to control the way the crystal forms as it solidifies.

- A [[fine grain structure]] is produced when you cool it down rapidly, this is because the number of [[Nucleation (crystal)|nulcleation]] events is increased and those crystals don't have sufficiant time to grow, resaulting in many smaller grains forming.
- A [[coarse grain structure]] or [[columnar grain structure]] can be created by cooling a fluid slowly/directionally.

### Example
![[Pasted image 20211104102322.png]]
- In the image you can see that there was rapid cooling at the edges of the cast, this caused a more [[fine grain structure]] to form
- Then since the temp gradient was more gradual a [[columnar grain structure]] was formed building on those edge grains

As you can see it
