#### What is
## Recovery (metallurgy)
This is a process by which deformed grains can reduce their sotred energy through the removal/rearrangement of [[dislocations]] in their crystal sturcture.

The structure has 3 stages during recovery:
1) Deformed structure - The structure starts with many dislocations that are in tangles making [[dislocation motion]] difficult.
2) Annihilation - 
3) Rearrangement -
