#### What is
## Recovery (metallurgy)
This is a process by which deformed grains can reduce their sotred energy through the removal/rearrangement of [[dislocations]] in their crystal sturcture.

The structure has 3 stages during recovery:
1) Deformed structure - The structure starts with many dislocations that are in tangles making [[dislocation motion]] difficult.
2) Annihilation - The increased temperature during [[annealing]] causes dislocations to move and when two of opposite kinds meet they cancel eachother out ([[big boom boom|annihilating eachother]]), this can continue until there is only one type of dislocation left
3) Rearrangement - Remaining dislocations rearrange themselves into ordered arrays, for example into a structure with low-angle grain boundays.
