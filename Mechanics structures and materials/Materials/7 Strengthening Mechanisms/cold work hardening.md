#### What is
## Cold work hardening
This is where high [[Stress|stress]] is applied to a material while at low temperatures past it's [[yield strength|yield stress]], this is to distort the grain structure.

It works because [[dislocations]] tangle together making it harder for them to move past eachother and also accumulate along grain boundaries, both of these processes make further [[dislocation motion]] harder. This also effects grain structure leading to more deformed grains with a high $D^{\underline{n}}$ density ([[whatever that means]]).
