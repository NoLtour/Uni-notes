#### What is a
## Spherulite ([[polymers]])
### Description
[[spherulite (polymers)|Spherulites]] are spherical [[polymer crystallinity|semicrystalline]] regions inside non-branched [[linear polymers]].

- It is the most common [[polymer crystalline structures|polymer crystalline structure]]
- Is a 3D structure consisting of spokes of lamellar chains of [[polymer crystallinity|crystalline polymer]]s seperated by [[polymer crystallinity|amorphous polymer]] regions
- Cool optical properties (not too relevant might add if needed)
