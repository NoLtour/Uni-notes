#### How would you go about
## Representing crystallographic directions
They can be represented using the format [XYZ] where:

> $$ [XYZ] $$ 
>> where:
>> $X=\frac{1}{x}$ 
>> $Y=\frac{1}{y}$
>> $Z=\frac{1}{z}$

Below you can see examples of this

Note that $\bar{1}$ means $-1$

#### General direction
This is formatted as $<XYZ>$
