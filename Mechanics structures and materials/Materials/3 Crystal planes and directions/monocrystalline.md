### Properties
It is anisotropic, so it has different properies in different directions/planes. This can lead to it have large differences in things like [[youngs modulus]] and [[Ultimate Tensile Strength]] in different directions along the crystal.

Monocrystalline materials can be used to make things such as turbine blades, this is because t
