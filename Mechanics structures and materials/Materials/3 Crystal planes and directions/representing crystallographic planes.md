#### How do you go about
## Representing crystallographic planes
The format is very simular to [[representing crystallographic directions]], except now the values in [XYZ] represent a point along an axis that the plane intercepts:

Here $A=[010]$

Here $B=[020]$

Here $C=[111]$

#### General planes

This also acts simularly to [[representing crystallographic directions#General direction|crystal general directions]] but the format now is $\{XYZ\}$, you can rotate a general plane 90 degrees around x,y,z.
