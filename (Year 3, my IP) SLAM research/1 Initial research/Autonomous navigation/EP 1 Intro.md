Heuristic Approach:
- Set of rules can allow vehicle to eventually achieve a goal
- EG:

- Doesn't require intelligent understanding of environment

Optimal approach:
- AI has a model of it's environment and makes complex choices to complete goal
- Closer to how humans work, think self driving

Generally heuristics are used to complement optimal, especially for finding solutions in cases where information is lacking but a set behaviour is likely to have a desireable outcome

The primary challange of autonomous navigation tends to be the uncertainty:
- Changes in the location of objects in the environment (less applicable to space)
- Unknowns in sensor data
- Random/chaotic factors influencing trajectorys (eg gusts)

Fundemental feedback loop of autonomous vehicles:
