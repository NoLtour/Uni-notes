## Streamline analysis in a compressible flow

By integrating the equations from [[conservation in a compressible flow]] we can get the following equations (The [[proof is here|Proof assosiated with compressible flow streamline stuff]]):

> ### $$\begin{align*} \text{Mass conservation:}&& \rho_{1} U_{1} &= \rho_{2} U_{2}\\\\\text{Momentum conservation:}&& \frac{1}{2} U^{2}_{2} + \int^{P_{2}}_{P_{1}} \frac{1}{\rho} \: dP &= \frac{1}{2} U_{1}^{2} \\\\  \text{Energy conservation:}&& h_{1} + \frac{1}{2} U_{1}^{2} &= h_{2} + \frac{1}{2} U_{2}^{2} \end{align*}$$ 
>> where:
>> $U=$ velocity
>> $\rho=$ fluid density (not constant) 
>> $h=$ specific [[enthalpy ]] 
>> $P=$ pressure

Notice that if you assume the momentum conservation equation has constant density, then you will just get the [[Bernouillis equation]].
