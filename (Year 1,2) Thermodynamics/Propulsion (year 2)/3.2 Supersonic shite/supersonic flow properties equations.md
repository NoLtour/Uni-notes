## Supersonic flow properties equations

These are a set of equations which describe conditions at some point in a supersonic flow. (derivation in given notes) The important thing is that these can be used to calculate changes in temperature across a supersonic wave front, which when combined with [[ideal gas law]] and [[streamline analysis in a compressible flow]] allows for derivation of other properties.

> ### $$\begin{align*} a  &= \sqrt{\gamma R T}  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} Ma  &= \frac{U}{a}  \end{align*}$$
> ### $$\begin{align*} \frac{T_{0}}{T} &= 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2} Ma^{2} \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $a=$ speed of sound
>> $Ma=$ [[Mach number]]
>> $U=$ velocity
>> $\gamma=$ [[isentropic expansion factor]]
>> $T=$ temp
>> $T_{0}=$ [[stagnation points in a compressible flow|stagnation temperature]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]
>
>> Note this uses assumption of [[perfect gas]] and that the process across the wave boundary is [[isentropic process|isentropic]] (no change in [[entropy]])
