#### What are the
## Types of process
### The types
 All of these use rearrangements of [[equations needed for calculating changes between states]].
 
There are 4 [[process (thermodynamics)|process]] types you need to know, you also need to know how they each look on [[p-v diagrams|pv diagrams]]. They are:
- [[isochoric heat transfer]] (constant volume)
- [[isobaric expansion or compression]] (constant pressure)
- [[isothermal expansion or compression]] (constant temperature)
- [[adiabatic expansion or compression]] (without heat transfer)

Those are the big ones but you should also know:
- [[Joule expansion]]
- [[isentropic process|isentropic]] (constant [[entropy]], valid when a process is [[adiabatic expansion or compression|adiabatic]] and [[reversible and irreversible processes|reversible]])
- [[isenthalpic process]] (constant [[enthalpy]])
