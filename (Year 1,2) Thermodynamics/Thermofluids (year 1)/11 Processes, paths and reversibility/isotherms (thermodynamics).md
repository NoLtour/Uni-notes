#### What are
## Isotherms (thermodynamics)
These are basically the lines on a [[p-v diagrams|pv diagram]] that follow a specific temperature. If you stay on that line you stay at that temperature.

Hence crossing isotherms is the same as changing temperature (all assuming constant mass of gas, so following [[ideal gas law]] assumptions).
