#### What are
## P-V diagrams
Also known as pressure, volume diagrams. I wonder if you can guess what two properties of a system they present, it's a really difficult thing to guess.
They are used to describe corresponding changes in volume and pressure in a system.

P-v diagrams are especially useful for describing [[process (thermodynamics)|processes]], this is because:
$$\begin{align*}
p (\Delta V) &= W 
\end{align*}$$
So for a process cycle (like that which exists in a heat engine):

We can find the theoretical work out by finding the area enclosed inside the diagram, with wasted energy being the area below the diagram.

The process is represented by the lines connecting different points.
