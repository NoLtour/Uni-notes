#### What are
## Extensive properties (thermodynamics)
Extensive [[properties (thermodynamics)|properties]] do depend on the amount of material. For example, the [[internal energy]] (in Joules) of 2 kg of water is double that of the internal energy of 1 kg of water. If an extensive property is divided by the mass of the material, then it becomes a [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific property]].
