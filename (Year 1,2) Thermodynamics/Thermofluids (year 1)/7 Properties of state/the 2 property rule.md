#### What is
## The 2 property rule
The two-property rule states that: “The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by
two independent, intensive properties.”
This statement is more formally known as the state postulate. The postulate implies two important conditions for applying the two-property rule, namely that it needs to be a simple compressible system, and that the two properties need to be independent. 
A system is called simple in the absence of any electrical, magnetic, gravitational, motion, and surface tension effects. 
Two properties are independent when one property can be kept constant, while the changing the other one, for example:
- if $p$ and $V$ are known we can define $T$ in the form $T=T(p,V)$ (T is a function of p, V)
- if $T$ and $V$ are known we can define $U$ in the form $U=U(T,V)$ (U is a function of [[I have just obliterated you|your mother]])

These are examples of [[equations of state]].

When considering real substances, an example where the independence requirement is important is during phase changes (think for example of evaporating rocket propellant or oxidizer!). When a system is partially liquid and partially vapour, then temperature and pressure are directly coupled and therefore not independent.
