#### What is the
## Pressure loss darcy weisbach equation
This equation can find the pressure loss due to [[boundary layers in pipes|pipe conditions]].

> ### $$ \Delta p = f_{D} \frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho V^{2}}{2}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $\Delta p=$ pressure loss
>> $f_{D}=$ [[darcy-weisbach friction factor]]
>> $L=$ Pipe length
>> $D=$ hydraulic diameter
>> $V=$ flow average velocity
>> $\rho=$ fluid density
