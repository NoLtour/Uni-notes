The total energy of an isolated system is constant, energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only change form.

> ### $$\begin{align*} \Delta U  &= Q - W  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $\Delta U=$ [[internal energy]] change of system
>> $Q=$ [[heat]] transfer into system
>> $W=$ [[thermodynamic work]] done, extracting energy from the system
