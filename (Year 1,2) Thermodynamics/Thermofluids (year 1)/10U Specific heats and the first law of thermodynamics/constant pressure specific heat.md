#### What is
## Constant pressure specific heat ($c_p$)
This is [[specific heat capacity]] for a subastance at a constant pressure.

> ### $$ c_{p} = c_{v} + R $$ 
>> where:
>> $c_{p}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]] 
>> $c_{v}=$ [[constant volume specific heat]]
>> $R=$ [[individual gas constant|specific gas constant]]


By using this and a bunch of definitions you get that:

> ### $$\begin{align*} c_{P}  &= \left. \frac{dh}{dT} \right|_{P=const}  \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $c_{P}=$ [[constant pressure specific heat]]
>> $h=$ [[specific properties (thermodynamics)|specific]] [[enthalpy]]
>> $T=$ temperature
