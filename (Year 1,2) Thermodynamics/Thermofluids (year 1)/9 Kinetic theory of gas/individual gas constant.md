#### What's a
## Individual gas constant ($R$)
This is a constant that is specific to a gas relating its molecular weight to the [[universal gas constant]].

> ### $$ R= \frac{R_{u}}{m_{u}} = \frac{\bar{R}}{M}$$ 
>> where:
>> $R=$ Individual gas constant
>> $R_u,\bar{R}=$ [[universal gas constant]]
>> $m_u,M=$ [[specific molecular weight]] 

Note for air it is 287
