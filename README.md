# Notes on "the notes"
### Overview
Contains memes with a side of aero/astro university notes. If nothing else it's useful for equations since variables are linked to relevant pages. Since the notes are written as I learn em the explanations are from the perspective of a student which means they can be easier to follow.

If you want to use these as your own then fork and be ready to modify notes because I can guarantee that there are going to be some errors in here.


### Graph of how things link up (not very practical but neat to look at)
This is an obsidian vault so yeah, use it with that thing. The graph showing page connections looks quite cool too (year 1 image):

Now the year 2 version:

You can probably tell but the only reason to go to university is to make obsidian notes so that you can get a cool graph. Literally no other reason.

### Examples
Now here is year 2 notes, this is the general layout of notes pages. Got intro and contents, some have intro's some don't:

Hyperlinks to related content, especially for obscure variables put into equations. Proofs will often reference previous proofs, that sort of thing makes notes much easier to follow.

Also some of the notes like aero have a bunch of python jupyter stuff embedded into em. This is especially applicable with potential flow stuff:

This horrible looking colour scheme is the result of some fool (me) who has no taste in themes (me) picking something trash (me) in year 1, here are a few examples of note pages from that shameful period:
