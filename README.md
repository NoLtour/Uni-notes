# Stuff and things
### Idk stuff
Contains memes with a side of aero/astro university notes. If nothing else it's useful for equations since variables are linked to relevant pages.

If you want to use these as your own then fork and be ready to modify notes because I can guarantee that there are going to be some errors in here.

### Cool graph
This is an obsidian vault so yeah, use it with that thing. The graph showing page connections looks quite cool too:

You can probably tell but the only reason to go to university is to make obsidian notes so that you can get a cool graph. Literally no other reason.

### Quality notes
