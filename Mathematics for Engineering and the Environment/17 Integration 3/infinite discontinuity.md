#### When do you use the term
## Infinite discontinuity
Basically when you calculate the value of an integral and find the value at one of it's limits tends to infinity (often because $\frac{1}{0} \to \infty$) for example: "the integrand ($f(x)=\frac{1}{(x-69)^{2}}$) has an infinite discontinuity at $x=69$"
