#### What is the
## Trace (matrices)
So if you take your [[principle diagonal (matrices)|principle diagonal]] and add up all those values you get the trace.
Expressed as an equation:

> ### $$ trace(Matrix) = a_{11}+ a_{22} ...+ a_{mn} = \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}a_{ii} $$ 
>> where:
>> $Matrix=$ any valid matrix 
>> $a_{ii}=$ a element at \[i\]\[i\] in the matrix
