#### What is are the
## Transposed matrix addition rules
Basically when you get a [[transposed matrix]] it has some funky behaviour:

> ### $$ (A+B)^{T} = A^{T} + B^{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $A=$ a matrix 
>> $B=$ a matrix

There is a special case for a [[square matrix]]:

> ### $$ (A^{T} + A)^{T} = (A^{T})^{T} + A^{T} = A+A^{T} $$ 
>> where:
>> $A=$ a [[square matrix]]
