#### What is a
## Cofactor (matrices)
So if we look back at [[finding the determinant of a 3x3 matrix]], each of those values we multiplied the det's by before adding them up were cofactors:

$$\begin{align*}
B &= \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &  a_{12} &  a_{13} \\  a_{21} &  a_{22} &  a_{23} \\  a_{31} &  a_{32} &  a_{33} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}$$

Its cofactors are:

$$  a_{11},- a_{12}, a_{13} $$
