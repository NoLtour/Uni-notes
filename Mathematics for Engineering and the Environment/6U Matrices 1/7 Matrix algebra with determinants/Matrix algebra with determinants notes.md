# Matrix algebra with determinants notes

#### Intro and contents
I am using this, in a few of these things:
![[MAWD Preset]]

The contents (the names arn't great but the book names arn't more precise):
- [[matrix sum row or column cofactor relationship]]
- [[multiple of a row by a scalar]]
- [[interchange of two rows or columns]]
- [[addition rule with matrix determinants]]
- [[adding multiples of rows or columns]]
- [[determinant of transposed matrix]]
- [[product of matrices and the resaulting determinant]]
- [[adjoint matrix]]
