#### What is the
## Matrix distrobutive law over addition

> ### $$ \begin{align*}(A+B)C &= AC + BC & C(A+B)&=CA+CB \end{align*} $$ 
>> where:
>> $A,B,C$ are matrices

Hence bracket expansion is still normal(ish), but note that the order of the matrices still matters (look back at [[matrix commutative law]])
