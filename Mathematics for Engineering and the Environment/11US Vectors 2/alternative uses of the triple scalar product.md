#### What are some
## Alternative uses of the triple scalar product
![[Pasted image 20220225114554.png]]

Well if you think about what the [[volume of parallelepiped|tripple scalar product]] represents geometrically, you can use it for the following:

1) > If $| (\underline{a} \times \underline{b}) \cdot \underline{c} |=0$ then all the vectors must lie on the same plane meaning one of the following is true:
> 1) Atleast one of the vectors is zero
> 2) Two of the vectors are parrallel
> 3) They are all on the same plane ([[look I wrote it for consistancy|duh]])

2) > We can re write it as the following:
>> ### $$ | (\underline{a} \times \underline{b}) \cdot \underline{c} | = | (\underline{c} \times \underline{b}) \cdot \underline{a} | $$ 
>>> where:
>>> $\underline{a},\underline{b},\underline{c}=$ some vectors
