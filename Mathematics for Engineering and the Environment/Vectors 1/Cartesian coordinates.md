# Cartesian coordinates

## Defining a point

There are two methods, these can be seen below.

#### Using Coordinates

Coordinate format: <span style="border-color:#0ba7f4;border-style:solid;margin-inline:5px;padding:3px"> $(x,y,z)$ </span>

#### Using Components

Coordinate format: <span style="border-color:#0ba7f4;border-style:solid;margin-inline:5px;padding:3px"> $(x_1,x_2,x_3...x_n)$ </span>

Although this is strange at a glance it makes sense when you consider that you may have many dimentions; so it's infinatly scalable and isn't limited to 3D space.
