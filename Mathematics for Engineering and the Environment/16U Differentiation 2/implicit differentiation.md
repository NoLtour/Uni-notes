#### What is
## Implicit differentiation
Something that is really important to keep in mind when working with differentiation is what you are actually doing, take this for example:
$$\begin{align*}
y &= x^{2} + 2x +5\\
\frac{dy}{dx} & = 2x + 2 
\end{align*}$$
Now what did you actually do there? Because in reality the method commonly used for differentiating skips an intermediate step which is:
$$\begin{align*}
y &= x^{2} + 2x +5\\
dy &= 2x dx + 2dx\\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= 2x + 2
\end{align*}$$
