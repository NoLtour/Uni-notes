#### What is the
## Linearity principle
This is based.

If we have two known solutions to $L[x]=0$ then we know that $ax_1+bx_2$ is a valid solution:

> ### $$ L[a x_1 + b x_2] = 0 $$ 
>> where:
>> $L[x_1]=0$ 
>> $L[x_2]=0$
>> $L[x]=$ a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous]] [[linear differential equation]]
>> $a,b=$ any arbitrary constant

This can be very useful when working with [[linear differential equation]]s.

This formula can be easily derived by rearranging [[operator notation to define linear differential equations#^785a09|this equation]].
