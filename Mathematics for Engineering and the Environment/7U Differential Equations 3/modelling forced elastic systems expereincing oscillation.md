#### Whats the method for
## Modelling forced elastic systems expereincing oscillation
[[insert funny message here|tldr]], you get the [[modelling oscillations of damped elastic systems using constant-coefficient differential equations|equation for modelling oscillating systems]] and add some thing onto it then use methods from [[general solution of linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations]].

### Intro
Basically this is where you have some oscillating system that has some extra driving force acting on it. There are some definitions you should probably be aware of:
- [[free vibrations]]
- [[forced vibrations]]

### Example
So if we model a lamp post vibrating in the wind:

Using a much of assumptions are rearrangements as described [[some stuff explaining|here]]
