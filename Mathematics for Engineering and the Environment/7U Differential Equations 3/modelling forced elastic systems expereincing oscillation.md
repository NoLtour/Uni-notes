#### Whats the method for
## Modelling forced elastic systems expereincing oscillation
[[insert funny message here|tldr]], you get the [[modelling oscillations of damped elastic systems using constant-coefficient differential equations|equation for modelling oscillating systems]] and add some thing onto it then use methods from [[general solution of linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations]].

### Intro
Basically this is where you are d
