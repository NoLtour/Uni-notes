#### What are
## Linearly dependent and independent functions

A linearly dependent functions are sets of functions that can be written interms of multiples of eachother.

> ### $$ k_1 f_1(t) + k_2 f_2(t) + k_3 f_3(t) + ... + k_n f_n(t) = 0 $$ 
>> where:
>> $\{f_1(t), f_2(t), f_3(t), \:...\: ,f_n(t)\}=$ set of functions 
>> $k=$ some constant
>> $f(t)=$ some function

### Example:

> Is $\{ 1+t, t^{2}, 1+t+4t^{2} \}$ a set of independent functions?

$$\begin{align*}
0 &= a(2+t) + b(t+2t^{2}) + c(1+t+4t^{2})\\
&= 2a+c + ct+ at + bt + 2bt^{2} +4ct^{2}\\
&& 0&=2a+0b+c & 0&= a + b + c & 0 &= 2b + 4c 
\end{align*}$$
