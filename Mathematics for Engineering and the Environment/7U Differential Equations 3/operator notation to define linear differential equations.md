#### How can we
## Operator notation to define linear equations

Any equation that can satisfy the following is a linear [[differential equation|differential]] equation:

> ### $$ L[ax_1 + bx_2] = aL[x_1] + bL[x_2] $$ 
>> where:
>> $x_1,x_2=$ all functions of x 
>> $a,b=$ any constant
>> $L[...]=$ a function function

### Example
Is $\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + 4t \frac{dx}{dt} - (\sin t)x = \cos t$ a linear differential equation?

$$\begin{align*}
L &= \frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}+ 
\end{align*}$$
