#### What is the
## General solution of a linear nonhomogeneous equation

First remember [[operator notation]] and the [[linearity principle]] now consider the following:

Let $L[x] = f(t)$ be a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|nonhomogeneous]] [[linear differential equation]].

Now let $x*$ be a solution of $L[x]$ so $L[x*] = f(t)$.

Now conider the related [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous equation]] $L[x]=0$, and let the solution of this be $x_c$ so $L[x_c]=0$.

According to the [[linearity principle]] since $x_c$ and $x*$ are solutions to $L[x]$ then $L[a x_c + b x*] = 0$
