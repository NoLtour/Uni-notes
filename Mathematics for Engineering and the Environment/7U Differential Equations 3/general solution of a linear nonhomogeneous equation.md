#### What is the
## General solution of a linear nonhomogeneous equation

Let $L[x] = f(t)$ be a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|nonhomogeneous]] [[linear differential equation]].

Now let $x*$ be a solution of $L[x]$ so $L[x*] = f(t)$.

Now conider the related [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous equation]] $L[x]=0$, and let the solution of this be $x_c$ so $L[x_c]=0$.

[[operator notation to define linear differential equations]]
If $L[x]$ is a [[linear differential equation]] then $L[ax_1 + bx_2] = aL[x_1] + bL[x_2]$ and since $x_c$ and $x*$ are solutions to $L[x]$ then:
$$\begin{align*}
L[x_c + x*] &= L[x_c] + L[x*]  & L[x_c]&=0 & L[x*] &= f(t)\\
L[x_c + x*] &= 0 + f(t)\\
\therefor &
\end{align*}$$
