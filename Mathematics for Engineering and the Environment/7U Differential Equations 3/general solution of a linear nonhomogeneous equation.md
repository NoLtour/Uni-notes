#### What is the
## General solution of a linear nonhomogeneous equation

Let $L[x] = f(t)$ be a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|nonhomogeneous]] [[linear differential equation]].

Now let $x*$ be a solution of $L[x]$ so $L[x*] = f(t)$.

Now conider the related [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous equation]] $L[x]=0$, and let the solution of this be $x_c$ so $L[x_c]=0$.

If $L[x]$ is a [[linear differential equation]] then ([[operator notation to define linear differential equations|from this]]) $L[ax_1 + bx_2] = aL[x_1] + bL[x_2]$ and since $x_c$ and $x*$ are solutions to $L[x]$ then:
$$\begin{align*}
L[x_c + x*] &= L[x_c] + L[x*]  & L[x_c]&=0 & L[x*] &= f(t)\\
L[x_c + x*] &= 0 + f(t)\\
\therefore L[x_c + x*] &= f(t)
\end{align*}$$

So $x_c + x*$ is a solution of $L[x]=f(t)$

> ### $$ L[x_c + x*] = f(t) $$ 
>> where:
>> $x_c=$ a solution of the homogeneous version of $L[x] = f(t)$
>> $x*=$ any solution of $L[x] = f(t)$
>> $L[x]=$ a [[linear differential equation]]

Note that we define the [[particular integral]] and [[complementary function]] from $x_c$ and $x*$.

It follows from this that finding the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation can be reduced to the problem of finding any solution of thenonhomogeneous equation and adding to it the general solution of the equivalent homogeneous equation.

In the event that you are totally confused we can do some examples.

### Examples

Find the general solution of $\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+ \lambda^{2}x = 4t^{3}$
