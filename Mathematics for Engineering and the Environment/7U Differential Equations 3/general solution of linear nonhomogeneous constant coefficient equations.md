#### How can you find the
## General solution of linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations







### Example

> Find the general solution of $\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + \frac{5dx}{dt} - 9x = t^{2}$

First we need a [[particular integral]], so we try something suitable, lets try $x(t)$

$$\begin{align*}


\end{align*}$$
