#### Whats the method for
## Modelling oscillations of damped elastic systems using constant-coefficient differential equations

### Intro
So if your lazy and want to model a pendulum you can assume no frictional forces are acting on it, then you can use a diagram such as the following:

And create an equation like:
$$ ml \frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}} = -R - mg\sin \theta $$
But this equation predicts that the
