#### What is
## Operator notation
Since functions can be passed as parameters it is also possible to define a function interms of the function passed to it:

> ### $$ \phi[ f(x) ] $$ 
>> where:
>> $\phi[...]=$ A function that takes a function as input 
>> $f(x)=$ A function

I don't think square brackets are manditory, but they seem like a good way 

#### Example
$$\begin{align*}
 \phi[ f(x) ] &= \frac{(f(x))^{2}}{5} + \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - \frac{f(x)}{f(x)-1}
\end{align*}$$
