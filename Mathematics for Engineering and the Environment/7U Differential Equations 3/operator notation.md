#### What is
## Operator notation
This is a way of representing functions:

> ### $$ f(g(x)) = fg(x) $$ 
>> where:
>> $g(x)=$ some function 
>> $f(x)=$ some function

Since functions can be passed as parameters it is also possible to define a function interms of the function passed to it:

> ### $$ \phi[ f(x) ] = \frac{(f(x))^{2}}{5} + \frac{d}{dx} f(x) - \frac{f(x)}{f(x)-1} $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$
