#### What is
## Arg (complex numbers)

This is a function that gives the angle between the positive real axis and the positive imaginary axis for some input complex number.

> ### $$ \theta = \arg z $$ 
> ### $$ z = |z|e^{i\theta} $$
> ### $$ z = a + ib $$
> ### $$ \arg z = 2\pi \arctan \frac{y}{x} $$
>> where:
>> $z=$ some complex number 
>> $n=0,1,2,3,4 ...=$ some integer
>> $a,b=$ the components of $z$
