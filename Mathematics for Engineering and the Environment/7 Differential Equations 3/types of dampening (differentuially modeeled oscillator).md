#### What are the
## Types of dampening (differentuially modeeled oscillator)
If we look back at [[modelling oscillations of damped elastic systems using constant-coefficient differential equations#^d6891c|this equation]], the [[damping parameter (differentially modelled oscillator)|damping parameter]] effect on motion is like the following:

We have some terms assosiated with each type of distinct resaulting behaviour:
> ### $$\begin{align*}\zeta > 1 \: &: \: over\:damped  \\\zeta = 1 \: &: \: critical\:dampening\\  \zeta < 1 \: &: \: under\:damped\end{align*}$$ 
>> where:
>> $\zeta=$ [[damping parameter (differentially modelled oscillator)|damping parameter]]

Note that during critical dampening you get the fastest return to equilibrium, hence why it's called that.
