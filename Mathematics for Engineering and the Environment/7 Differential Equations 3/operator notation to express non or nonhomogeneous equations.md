#### How can we use
## [[operator notation|Openrator notation]] to express [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|non or nonhomogeneous equations]]

So this is a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous equation]] using [[operator notation]]:
$$\begin{align*}
L[x(t)] &= 0
\end{align*}$$

This is a nonhomogeneous equation:
$$\begin{align*}
L[x(t)] &= f(x)
\end{align*}$$
