#### What is a
## Linear differential equation
A linear differential equation is a [[differential equation|differential]] equation that is defined by a linear polynomial in the unknown function and its derivatives, that is an equation of the form:

> ### $$ f(x) = (a_0(x) \times y)  + \left(a_1(x) \times \frac{dy}{dx}\right) + \left(a_2(x) \times \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}\right) + ... + \left(a_n(x) \times \frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}}\right)  $$ 
>> where:
>> $f(x)=$ linear differential equation
>> $a(x)=$ some arbitrary differentiatable function

Note that a linear differential equation will be differentiatable.
