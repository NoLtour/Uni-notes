#### Whats the method for
## Solving linear equations with matricies
We commonly need to find the unkowns in a set of linear equations:

> Given $x+5y-z=7$, $-2x+23y+21z=5$ and $y+4z=0$ find $x,y,z$.

If we rewrite the given equations in the form:
$$\begin{align*}
x+5y-z&=7\\
-2x+23y+21z&=5\\
+0x+y+4z&=0\\
\end{align*}$$
