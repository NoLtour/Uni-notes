#### Whats the method for
## Using elementary row operations to get the upper-triangular form
Fuck I don't have any illuminati memes, ok this sucks I need to find some one moment. [[yes I am using a meme from the stone age fucking cope|found one]]

Ok so we know that [[elementary row operations with constant solutions|elementary row operations]] can be used to manipulate matrices representing linear equations without changing the solution, so what we are doing here is using these methods to get it the [[square matrix]] in the equation matrix thing into a [[upper-triangular matrix]] where elements along the diaganal are all 1.

To do this we apply the following to each row:
1) Subtract some multiple of another row in the matrix to get the element that should be zero to be zero
2) Divide the row
