#### 
## Using the elimination method to invert matrices
[[matrices are useful but also the root of all pain and suffering|Here we introduce an even more tidious method for inverting matrices, your stupid ass didn't think it could get worse lmao.]]

Basically you start by adding a [[unit matrix]] onto the end of your current matrix, then you do the following for each colum starting from the left:
- Get the diaganal element equal to one
- Get all other rows to have a zero in that column
- Move onto next column

Now the unit matrix

Although this looks like a massive pain in the ass (because it is), it is useful as it works on all sizes of [[square matrix]].
