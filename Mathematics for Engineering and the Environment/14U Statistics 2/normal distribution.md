#### What is the
## Normal distribution
This is where a [[bernoulli trial]] is applicable, and the following equation can be used to reonably accuratly determine the fraction of the total population that rests within a given range:

> ### $$ f_{pop} = \int^{x_{max}}_{x_{min}} \dfrac{e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^{2} } }{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $f_{pop}$ The fraction of the population that has an $x$ value between $x_{max}$ and $x_{min}$, equivilent to the probability that $X$ lies between $x_$
>> $\mu=$ [[mean value by integration|mean value]]
>> $\sigma=$ [[standard deviation for probabability functions|standard deviation]]


(The following is a [[normal distribution]] graph, showing the equation $\frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right)^{2} } }{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$)
