#### What is the
## Standard error of the sample mean  ($\sigma_{\bar{X}}$)
If you take a sample from a large population the mean of the sample will not be perfectly equal to the actual mean of the population, which a larger sample the error will decrease, we call this error the [[standard error of the sample mean]] and it is calculated using:

> ### $$ \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\sigma_{X}}{\sqrt{n}} $$ 
> ### $$ \sigma_{\bar{X}}^{2} = \frac{\sigma_{X}^{2}}{{n}} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=$ [[standard error of the sample mean]]
>> $\sigma_{X}=$ [[standard deviation for probabability functions|standard deviation]] of population
>> $n=$ size of sample

This works for both [[normal distribution]] and [[binomial distribution]]. (because [[you should be able to figure it out|reasons]])
