#### What is a
## Sample mean and variance
### Intro
This is where you calculate mean/variance from a sample instead of from known probabilitys, in most real world applications a resonably small dataset can produce a resonably accurate mean and varience.

### Mean
> ### $$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} x_{i} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{x}=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample mean]] 
>> $n=$ number of sampled values

### Varience
> ### $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{x}=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample mean]] 
>> $\sigma^{2}=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample varience]]
>> $\sigma=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample normal distrobution]]
>> $n=$ number of sampled values

Note that when considering small samples sizes the following equation needs to be used instead:

> ### $$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^{2} $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{x}=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample mean]] 
>> $\sigma^{2}=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample varience]]
>> $\sigma=$ [[sample mean and variance|sample normal distrobution]]
>> $n=$ number of sampled values
