#### What is a
## Confidence interval
Given a random sample of the population, the confidence interval is the likelyhood that the mean of your sample is within a [[standard error of the sample mean]]:

> ### $$ P( \mu_{X} + \sigma_{\bar{X}} > \bar{X} > \mu_{X} - \sigma_{\bar{X}}  ) = I_{conf} $$ 
>> where:
>> $I_{conf}=$ [[confidence interval]] 
>> $\mu_{X}=$ actual mean of population
>> $\bar{X}=$ sampled mean
>> $\sigma_{\bar{X}}=$ [[standard error of the sample mean]]

([[I mean it|I really really hate stats]])

So for example if you use a [[confidence interval]] of 95% and your sample lies more than a [[standard error of the sample mean]] then that has a 5% likelyhood, so you can see how this could be useful in [[hypothesis testing]].
