#### 
## Integration by substitution common cases

This is just [[integration using the general composite rule|integration by substitution]] but some cases that are specifically mentioned in the book ([[idk I want to put a meme here|excuse]], [[here its math themed|also this]]).

### Form $\frac{dx}{dt} = f\left(\frac{x}{t}\right)$
#### Equation
The substitution is $y=\frac{x}{t}$ which is rearranged into $x=yt$ then from [[What's the product rule|product rule]] gives $\frac{dx}{dt} = t \frac{dy}{dt} + y$.

> ### $$ \frac{dx}{dt} = f\left(\frac{x}{t}\right) $$
> ### $$ \frac{dx}{dt} = t \frac{dy}{dt} + y $$ 
> ### $$ x = yt $$
>> where:
>> $y=$ the substitution variable

#### Example
> Solve:
> $$ t^{2} \frac{dx}{dt} = x^{2} + xt $$

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \frac{x^{2}}{t^{2}} + \frac{x}{t}\\
& & y &= \frac{x}{t}\\
&= y^{2} + y\\
&
\end{align*}$$
