#### 
## Solution of exact differential equations
Lil bit of intro information, (assuming I actually understand this) so if you have multiple variables then it is common for one to determine the other, eg $t$ determines the value of $x$ (For example if $x=\sin t$ then $x$ is determined by $t$ because the solution is ambiguous with $t=\arcsin x$), but it would be nice if there was some way to prove that such a relationship exists for the purposes of calculus and to figure out which variables determine the other.

Such a test does exist it is:
> ### $$ \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{\delta h}{\delta x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\delta h}{\delta t} $$ 
>> where:
>> $h=h(t,x)=$ a function of $t,x$ where $\frac{dh}{dt}=0$ 
>> $d=$ [[derivative symbols#d x total derivative|this maths thing]]
>> $\delta=$ [[derivative symbols#delta x partial derivative|this other max thing]]
