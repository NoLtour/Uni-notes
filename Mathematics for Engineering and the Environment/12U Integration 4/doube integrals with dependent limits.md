#### Describe how you solve
## Doube integrals with dependent limits
So you know how I said that [[double integrals with independent limits|double integrals]] are easy, they only become difficult when limits get fucky well that's what this is about. What it essentially comes down to is the fact that to integrate something you have to fully expand all variables that can be defined interms of the variable your integrating for. For example if you have a function $y(x)$ where $y = x+2$ if you have to integrate $\int xy dx$ then:
$$\begin{align*}
\int xy \cdot dx &\\
\int x(x+2) \cdot dx & 
\end{align*}$$
