#### Describe
## Calculus with vectors
Yum [[integration]], [[differentiation]] and [[Scalars and vectors|vectors]]...

Ok looks like it's basically the same as normal but you do the thing to each part of the stuff (clear?), except these 2 rules also exist:

> ### $$ \frac{d}{dt} [ \underline{u}(t) \times \underline{v}(t) ] = \frac{d\underline{u}}{dt} \times \underline{v} + \underline{u} \times \frac{d\underline{v}}{dt}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{v},\underline{u}=$ are vector funtions
>> Since [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]] is used, order matters!


> ### $$ \frac{d}{dt} [ \underline{u}(t) \cdot \underline{v}(t) ] = \frac{d\underline{u}}{dt} \cdot \underline{v} + \underline{u} \times \frac{d\underline{v}}{dt}  $$ 
>> where:
>> $\underline{v},\underline{u}=$ are vector funtions
>> [[dot product (vectors)|dot product]] used
