## Vector equation of a line

Basically this is defining a vector that goes from a origin point to any point on a line through two points:

(An equation for getting point P (defined using $\underline{r}$) using $\underline{a}$ and $\underline{b}$)

This uses basic [[Addition of vectors|vector addition]], since $\underline{a}$ and $\underline{b}$ originate from the same point:
$$\begin{align*}
\vec{BA} &= \underline{a} - \underline{b}\\
\vec{AP}&
\end{align*}$$
