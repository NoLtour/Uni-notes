#### Define
## Domain ([[function|functions]])
### Def
The domain of a function is the set of values used as inputs into the [[function]].


### Example
> Given the [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] of the function $f(x)=5x+e^{x}+2$ is $0\leq f(x)< 3$ what is the functions [[domain (functions)|domain]]?

$$\begin{align*}
f(x) &= 5x+e^{x}+2\\
f(x) - 5x &= e^{x}+2
\end{align*}$$

Hence the [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] is: $2\leq f(x) < e^{10} +2$

Note that it may be nessisary to draw a graph to ensure the [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] applies in the way you expect, here that wasn't needed since the behaviour is predictable.
