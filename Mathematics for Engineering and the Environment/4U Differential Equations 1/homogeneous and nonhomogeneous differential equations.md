#### What are the differences between
## Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations
### Complex and deep explenation
This is an insanely complex topic, so unless you have a galaxy brain you will not beable to even come close to comprehending the full complexity and depth of this definition...

- Differential Homogeneous  equation - Equal to zero
- Differential Nonhomogeneous equation - Not


### Example
#### Homogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
    \frac{dx}{dt}+ 4x &= 0\\
4 \frac{dx}{dt} + x\sin t &= 0
\end{align*}$$

#### Nonhomogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
   \frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}} + t \frac{dx}{dt} &= 4 \sin t\\
\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}} - 4x \frac{df}{dx} &= 69 
\end{align*}$$
