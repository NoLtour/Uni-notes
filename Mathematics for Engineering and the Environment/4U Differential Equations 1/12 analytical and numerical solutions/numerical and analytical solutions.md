#### What are
## Numerical and analytical solutions
#### Analytical solution
A solution that can be found using mathamatical techniques, usually resaulting in producing a formula that can give a solution.

#### Numerical solution
This is when people have a "[[mild case of being trash|skill issue]]" and either because it isn't possible with current mathamatical techniques or some other reason use things like tables and interpolation to find the solution.
Generally an [[numerical and analytical solutions|analytical solution]] will be prefered over a [[numerical and analytical solutions|numerical solution]].
