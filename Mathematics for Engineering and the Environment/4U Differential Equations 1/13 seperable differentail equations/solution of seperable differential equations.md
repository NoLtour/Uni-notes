#### What is the method for the
## Solution of seperable differential equations

Given some differential equation, if possible rearrange it so that like variables are on the same side:

> ### $$ \begin{align*}given: \:\:\frac{dy}{dx} &= f(x, y)\\g(y) \frac{dy}{dx} &= h(x)\\g(y)\cdot dy &= h(x) \cdot dx\end{align*} $$ 

You can see it is easy to solve in it's final form.
