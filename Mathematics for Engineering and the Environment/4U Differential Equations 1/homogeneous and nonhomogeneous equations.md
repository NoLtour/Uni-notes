#### What are the differences between
## Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations
### Complex and deep explenation
This is an insanely complex topic, so unless you have a galaxy brain you will not beable to even come close to comprehending the full complexity and depth of this definition...

- Homogeneous - Has zero on left
- Nonhomogeneous - Dosn't


### Example
#### Homogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
    &= 
\end{align*}$$

#### Nonhomogeneous
$$\begin{align*}
    &= 
\end{align*}$$
