## Solving linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equations
![[linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equation#^9a6d21]]

1) 
> Treat it like a quadratic and find it's roots:
> $$ \begin{align*}
a \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}+ b \frac{dx}{dt} + cx &= 0 &\to&& am^{2}+bm+c&=0\\
&& &
\end{align*} $$
2) 
> Depending on what roots are found one of the following formats is used:
