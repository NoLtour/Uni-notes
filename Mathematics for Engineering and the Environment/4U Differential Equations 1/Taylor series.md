#### What is the
## Taylor series
### Method
In mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point.

For a given function ($f(x)$) it's [[Taylor series]] can be defined at a value of x (where $x=a$), by the following equation:

> ### $$ \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^{n} $$
> ### 
> ### $$ f(a) + \frac{f^{'}(a) }{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f^{''}(a) }{2!}(x-a)^{2}+ \frac{f^{'''}(a) }{3!}(x-a)^{3}+ \frac{f^{''''}(a) }{4!}(x-a)^{4} + ... $$ 
>> where:
>> $f^{(n)}(a)=$ nth derivative of $f(a)$

It is an increasingly accurate approximation of the function $f(a)$.

There is a special case of the [[Taylor series]], which is when $a=0$ we call this a [[Maclaurin series]].
