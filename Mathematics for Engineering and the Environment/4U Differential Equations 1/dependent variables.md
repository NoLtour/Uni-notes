#### What are
## Dependent variables
### Definition
1) These are the variables in an equation that have their values defined interms of the values of other variables (usually by [[independent variables]]).
2)  In an experiment, their values are studied under the hypothesis or requirement that they depend, by some law/rule/equation, on the values of other variables.

### Example
$y=x+1$
Here $y$ is the dependent variable.

But as you can see the above equation can be rearranged so that $x$ is the dependent variable, so often it is more useful to use the second definition.
