# Integration as antiderivative
Applying [[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]] we can get lots of general cases for intergrations using the "opposites" of their differentiations. So based on this we can go through [[Basic rules of differentiation]] and get their integration counterparts.

### Rules

1) ![[Integration scalar-multiplication rule]]
2) ![[Integration linear composite rule]]
3) ![[Integration sum rule]]
4) ![[Intergration inverse-function rule]]
5) ![[Integration by parts]]
6)
