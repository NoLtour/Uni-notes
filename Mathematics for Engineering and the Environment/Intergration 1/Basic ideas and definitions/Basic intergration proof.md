#### What's the method for the
## Basic intergration proof
Consider you want to find the area under a graph, it's simple enough for a basic graph like:

But for a more complex graph:

Finding the area becomes much more difficult, here you could approximate the area by calculating the area of stips of the graph:

Here the inaccuracy of b and c will decrease as the frequency of bars increases. (if you remember [[Proof of basic differentiation|Differentiation proof]] then you see whats going on here)

If we take this method to an extreem and we keep decreasing the stip width it can be expressed formally as:
