# Complex numbers 2 overview

#### Intro and contents
I don't think I ever did complex numbers 1. It's kinda ez so I just skipped it, (these notes are open source, add it yourself [[what else do you expect|trol]])
- [[representing complex numbers using angle and magnitude|euler's formula]]
- [[relating circular and hyperbolic functions]]
- Osbornes rule ([[UNFINISHED STUFF]] idk I'll just look up the formula when I need em)
