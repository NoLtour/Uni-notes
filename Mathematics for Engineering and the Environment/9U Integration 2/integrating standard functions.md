#### Whats the method for
## Integrating standard functions
We can easily integrate standard functions by substituting the following standard resaults in when we see them (assuming they are in a situation where it is appropriate to do so):

> ### $$ \int x^{n} \cdot dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}  +c $$
> ### $$ \int e^{x} \cdot dx = +c $$
