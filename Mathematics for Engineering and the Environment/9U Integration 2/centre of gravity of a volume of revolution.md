#### How can we find
## Centre of gravity of a volume of revolution
Here we use the equations for [[volume of a solid of revolution]] and [[centroid of a plane area|centre of area of a graph]], here we are working around the x axis:

We can instantly tell that the centre lies on the x axis hence $\bar{Y} = 0$, we need to use moments to find $\bar{X}$.

We take the following from the previously mentioned pages.

> ### $$ V = \pi \int^{b}_c [ f(x) ]^{2} \cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $V=$ Volume of curve rotated 360 degrees around x axis
>> $a,b=$ points on x axis
>> $f(x)=$ Function of curve

> ### $$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{A} \int^{b}_a xf(x) \cdot dx $$
>> where:
>> $A= \int^{b}_a f(x)\cdot dx$ 
>> $\bar{x} =$ center of x
>> $a,b=$ limits
>> $f(x)=$  function that defines the curve
