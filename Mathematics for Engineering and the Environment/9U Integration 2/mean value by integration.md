#### How can we find the
## Mean value by integration
Now if you think about this for more than one second you can come up with the formula yourself.

> ### $$ \bar{m} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int^{b}_a f(x) \cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $\bar{m}=$ mean value in range a,b 
>> $a,b=$ range
>> $f(x)=$ continous function (within limits)

If you couldn't figure it out you are [[I need to insult you so I will add a meme|bad]].

Note that this equation averages with negative values too, so for something like [[alternating current]] it would say the mean is zero, which is right but not that useful, hence sometimes we will use [[root mean square by integration]].
