#### What is the equation for the
## Mean median and mode of continous probability functions

### Mean

This is easy enough:

> ### $$ \bar{x} = \mu = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} x \times f_{X}(x) \cdot dx $$ 
>> where:
>> $\mu=\bar{x}=$ mean value of $x$
>> $f_{X}(x)=$ a [[probablility function]] for $x$

### Mode

Super easy:

> ### $$ f_{X}(x_{mode}) = P_{max} $$
>> where:
>> $f_{X}(x)=$ [[probablility function]] of $x$
>> $x_{mode}=$ mode
>> $=$
