#### Describe
## Conditional probablility 
This is the probability of something happening assuming something else has happened, for example an expression for the probability of B occuring given A occured is:
> ### $$ P(B|A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} $$ 
>> where:
>> $B=$ event that might occur 
>> $A=$ event that has occured

On a ven diagram the above thing is the same as taking a sub section of the main venn diagram:
