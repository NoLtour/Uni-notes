#### What is a method for
## Finding the number of combinations
For many situations you have a discrete variable that can take on some number of states and then a squence of these variables, for some set length of sequence there is a set number of combinations possible, for example if a 6 sided dice is rolled twice the number of possible outcomes is $6^{2}=36$ so expressed mathamatically:

> ### $$ N = P $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$
