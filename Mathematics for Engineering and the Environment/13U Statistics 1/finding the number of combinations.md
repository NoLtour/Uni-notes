#### Describe methods for
## Finding the number of combinations
### [[mutually exclusive events|Mutually exclusive]] sequence of events
#### Theory
For many situations you have a discrete variable that can take on some number of states and then a squence of these variables, for some set length of sequence there is a set number of combinations possible, for example if a 6 sided dice is rolled twice the number of possible outcomes is $6^{2}=36$ so expressed mathamatically:

> ### $$ N = P^{L} $$ 
>> where:
>> $N=$ number of possible outcomes
>> $P=$ number of possible [[mutually exclusive events]] per outcome
>> $L=$ length of outcome list


#### Example
> Find the number of combina some hypothetical 3 sided coin
