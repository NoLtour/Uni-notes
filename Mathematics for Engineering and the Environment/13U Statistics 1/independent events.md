#### Describe
## Independent events

This is where the outcome of one event is independent of another, basically for two events to be independent the following equations are true:
> ### $$ P( A \cup B ) = P(A) + P(B)  $$ 
> ### $$ P( A \cap B ) = P(A) \times P(B)  $$ 
> ### $$ P(A|B) = P(A) $$ 
> ### $$ P(B|A) = P(B) $$
>> where:
>> $A,B=$ independent events
>> Used [[conditional probablility]]

Independent does not mean [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]] you can have events that a
