#### Describe
## Independent events

This is where the outcome of one event is independent of another, basically for two events to be independent the following equations are true:
> ### $$ P( A \cup B ) = P(A) + P(B)  $$ 
> ### $$ P(A|B) = P(B) $$
>> where:
>> $A,B=$ independent events

On a ven diagram this would be equivilent to two probablility circles not overlapping:
