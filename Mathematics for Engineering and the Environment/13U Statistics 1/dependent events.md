#### Describe
## Dependent events
These are events that arn't [[independent events]] (real shocker), this is where the outcome of one event has an effect on the outcome of the other. Expressed mathamatically is:
> ### $$ P(A \cup B) = P(A \cap \bar{B}) + P(B \cap \bar{A}) + P(A \cap B) $$ 
> ### $$ P(A \cup B) < P(A) + P(B) $$
>> where:
>> $A,B=$ dependent events
