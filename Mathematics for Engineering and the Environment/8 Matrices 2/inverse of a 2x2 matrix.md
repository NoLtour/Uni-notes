#### What is the
## Inverse of a 2x2 matrix
Although you can use the method from [[inverse matrix]], 2x2's can be simplified into the following:

> ### $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} $$
> ### $$ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} $$ 
>> where:
>> $|A|\neq$ 0 

This is the same thing from the [[inverse matrix]] page, just put into a form that can be subbed into easily.
