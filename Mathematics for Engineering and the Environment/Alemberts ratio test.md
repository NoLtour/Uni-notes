#### What is
## Alemberts [[get retio ed|ratio]] test

Basically it's the idea that if we have some series then using the ratio of consecutive terms we can tell if it diverges:

> ### $$ \begin{align*}
\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} < 1 &: converges\\
\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} > 1 &: diverges\\
\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} = 1 &: unknown
\end{align*} $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$
