#### What are some
## Common sequences and series

### Arithmetical series
> ### $$ S_{n} = \sum\limits^n=1 $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$


### Geometric series

> ### $$ S_{n} = \sum\limits^{n-1}_{k=0} ar^{k} = \frac{a(1-r^{n})}{1-r} $$ 
>> where:
>> $S_{n}=$ value of series 
>> $n=$ series length
>> $a,r=$ constants
