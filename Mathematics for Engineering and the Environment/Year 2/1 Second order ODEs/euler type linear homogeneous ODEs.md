## Euler type linear homogeneous ODEs

### What it is

So these are actually quite cool (and common), as you'll see in a bit this is a [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous]] Euler type:

> ### $$ x^{2} \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + bx \frac{dy}{dx} + c y = 0 $$ 

What you'll note is the difference between this and a [[solving linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equations|linear second order homogeneous ODE]] is the multiplication by decreasing powers of $x$, these actually cancel out with the differentials leading to a dimensionless equation.

### Solving it



### Theory to solve it

So basically if you recall the method from [[solving linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equations#Proofing solving linear homogeneous constant-coefficient equations Method the method|this proof]], it's the same(ish). We need to find 2 [[linearly dependent and independent functions|linearly independent functions]] that solve the equation.

Of course the first step is to guess what this function is, since this is a proof [[I am omnipitent ghuahahhd|my guess is right]]
