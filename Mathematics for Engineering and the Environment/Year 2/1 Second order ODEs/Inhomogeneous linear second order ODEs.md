## Inhomogeneous linear second order ODEs

So now we get to start dealing with ODEs which are not [[homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations|homogeneous]], aka where in the ODE ($\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = r(x)$) the function $r(x) \not\equiv 0$. 
Note that $r(x)$ is often refered to as a [[source t]]
