## Separation of variables for the elliptic PDEs
### Intro
Just doing [[separation of variables]] on [[elliptic partial differential equations|elliptic PDEs]], specifically Laplaces equation:
$$ \frac{\delta^{2}u}{\delta x^{2}} + \frac{\delta^{2}u}{\delta y^{2}} = 0 $$
Something that's noteable is that the laplace equation can also be written using the [[del operator]] to define the laplace equation in the nth dimension:
$$ \nabla^{2} u = 0 $$
Also unlike the previous examples where we used $y$ as the solution we are using $u$, since well $y$ is being used for a spacial variable (duh).

### Boundary conditions
As discussed in [[elliptic partial differential equations|elliptic PDEs]], the problem needs to have 4 defined boundary conditions

### Example
> Solve $\nabla u=0$ in 2 dimensions with boundary conditions
