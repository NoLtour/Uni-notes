## Hyperbolic partial differential equations

Hyperbolic PDEs are usually associated with wave propagation, and are central to hydro- and electro- dynamics. What is important to note about [[hyperbolic partial differential equations|hyperbolic PDEs]] is that information is propagated at a finite speed. For example:

$$ \frac{\delta^{2} u}{\delta t^{2} } = c^{2} \frac{\delta^{2} u}{ \delta x^{2} } $$

This is an example of a hyperbolic PDE, in which its graph can be seen bloew, i what is noteable is that as time proffresses the wave moves and there is no movement of "information" faster than what is permitted that the variable that in this case is defining inform
