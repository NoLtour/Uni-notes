## Parabolic partial differential equations

Parabolic PDEs are usually associated with diffusion problems. Parabolic PDEs can be described as situations where information is propagated instantly (an infinite speed), this is often done for situations where such an approximation does not have significant effect on the output.
An example would be the heat equation:
$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\delta u}{\delta y }  &= k \frac{\delta^{2}u}{\delta x^{2}}
\end{align*}$$
When plotted it can be seen that 
In situations that occur on a microscopic scale the rate of information transfer can often be accurately approximated as instantaneous, hence it is common to use [[parabolic partial differential equations|parabolic PDEs]] in such situations.
