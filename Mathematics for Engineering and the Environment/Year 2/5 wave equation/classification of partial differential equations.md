## Classification of partial differential equations

If you thought the previous content about [[ordinary differential equation|ODEs]] was bad, then look at this abomination:

$$ a \frac{\delta^{2} u}{ \delta x^{2} } + 2b \frac{\delta^{2}u}{\delta x \delta y} + c \frac{\delta^{2} u}{\delta y^{2}} + d \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + e \frac{\delta u}{\delta y} $$
