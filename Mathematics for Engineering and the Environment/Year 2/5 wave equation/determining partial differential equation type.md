## Determining partial differential equation type

It's quite easy to find the [[classification of partial differential equations|classification of PDEs]]. This is the most general case of second order linear PDEs:
$$ a \frac{\delta^{2} u}{ \delta x^{2} } + 2b \frac{\delta^{2}u}{\delta x \delta y} + c \frac{\delta^{2} u}{\delta y^{2}} + d \frac{\delta u}{\delta x} + e \frac{\delta u}{\delta y} + fu = 0 $$
