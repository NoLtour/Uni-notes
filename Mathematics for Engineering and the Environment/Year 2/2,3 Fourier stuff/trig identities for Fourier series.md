## Trig identities for Fourier series

These trig identities are quite obvious if you think about them a bit, but since they come up __a lot__ in [[Fourier Series Overview|Fourier series]] it's good to clearly state them here for clarity sake:

> ### $$ \sin(n \pi) = 0 $$ 
> ### $$ \sin\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi\right] = (-1)^{n} $$ 
> ### $$ \cos(n \pi) = (-1)^{n} $$ 
> ### $$ \cos\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi\right] = 0 $$ 
>> where:
>> $n=$ is any __integer__ 

These identities are simply the result of where the functions loop, the $(-1)^n$ is simply an expression that alternates between $+1$ and $-1$.

> ### $$ \sin(n \pi) = \cos\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi\right] $$ 
> ### $$ \cos(n \pi) = \sin\left[\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \pi\right] $$  

Also this, which is a result of $\cos$ being a [[even function]] and $\sin$ being an [[odd function]]:

> ### $$ \sin( -x ) = -\sin( x ) $$ 
> ### $$ \cos( -x ) = \cos( x )  $$
