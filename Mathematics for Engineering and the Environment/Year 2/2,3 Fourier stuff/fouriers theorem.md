## Fouriers theorem
These are the Diri[[dir shlit|chlet]] conditions:
- $f(x)$ is bounded
- $f(x)$ is periodic with period $2L$
- $f(x)$ has a finite number of extrema and discontinuities in $-L \leq x \leq L$

The Dirshit conditions must be met in order for it to be possible for a [[Fourier Series Overview|Fourier series]] to exist for that function.


Fourierâ€™s Theorem essentially states that: If $f(x)$ obeys the Dirichlet conditions then the Fourier series converges, and:
- If $f(x)$ is continuous, the series converges to $f(x)$ at a given point $x$
- If $f(x)$ is discontinuous at a given point x, at this point x the series converges to the average value at the jump (average value between the two points where the jump occurs)
