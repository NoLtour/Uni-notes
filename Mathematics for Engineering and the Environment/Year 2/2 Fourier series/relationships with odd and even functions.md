## Relationships with odd and even functions

There are intresting relationships that you can get by combining [[odd function]]s and [[even function]]s, here we explore them.

> ### $$ f(x) \times g(x) = f(-x) \times g(-x) = H(x) $$ 
>> where:
>> $H(x)=$ a new [[even function]] 
>> $f(x),g(x)=$ [[even functions]]
>> $=$
