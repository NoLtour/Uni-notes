## Complex fourier series
[[It took me 20 mins to find this in my meme folder|Fourier complex? I find it quite simple.]]


Pretty much take the complex trig identities and apply them to the [[Fourier Series Overview|Fourier series]] stuff:

$$\begin{align*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} a_{0} + \sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=1}\left[ a_{n} \cos \left( \frac{n\pi}{L} x \right) + b_{n} \sin \left(\frac{n\pi}{L} x\right) \right]
\end{align*}$$
