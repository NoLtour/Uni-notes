## Shortcuts for the fourier series

![[defining the fourier series#^3f0fc8]]

If we look at the equation that actually defines the [[Fourier Series Overview|Fourier series]] we can tell that:
- $a_{0}$ is responsible for the vertical shift ($a_{0}=0$ means the area above and below the x axis are equal since everything else is constructed from $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions)
- $a_{n}$ creates patterns which are symetric about the y axis (aka )




### Example: Tent function

> ![[Pasted image 20221011163613.png]]

From the graph we can clearly see that the function is $f(x)=|x|$ in the range $-\pi\leq x \leq \pi$ repeating every $2\pi$. 

So now we just sub the function into [[defining the fourier series#^918760|these equations]] and solve to get definitions for the constants, but something should
