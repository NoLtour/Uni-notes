## Shortcuts for the fourier series

![[defining the fourier series#^3f0fc8]]

If we look at the equation that actually defines the [[Fourier Series Overview|Fourier series]] we can tell that:
- $a_{0}$ is responsible for the vertical shift ($a_{0}=0$ means the area above and below the x axis are equal since everything else is constructed from $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions).
- $a_{n}$ creates graphs which are symetric about the y axis (aka purely $\cos$ based functions will be [[even function]]s).
- $b_{n}$ creates graphs which are clearly [[odd function]]s (if made solely out of sin functions).

Hence from this it becomes obvious that:
- If a function is a [[odd function]] then in its [[Fourier Series Overview|fourier series]] $a_{n}=0$ and $a_{0}=0$.
- If a function is a [[even function]] then in its [[Fourier Series Overview|fourier series]] $a_{n}=0$ and $a_{0}=0$.
- If a function is a [[odd function]] then in its [[Fourier Series Overview|fourier series]] $a_{n}=0$ and $a_{0}=0$.



### Example: Tent function

From the graph we can clearly see that the function is $f(x)=|x|$ in the range $-\pi\leq x \leq \pi$ repeating every $2\pi$. 

So now we just sub the function into [[defining the fourier series#^918760|these equations]] and solve to get definitions for the constants, but something should
