## Shortcuts for the fourier series








### Example: Tent function

From the graph we can clearly see that the function is $f(x)=|x|$ in the range $-\pi\leq x \leq \pi$ repeating every $2\pi$. 

So now we just sub the function into [[defining the fourier series#^918760|these equations]] and solve to get definitions for the constants.
