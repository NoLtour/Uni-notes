## Defining half range series
### Intro
It's possible to be given a function where you only know it's definition for half the range ($0\leq x < L$) in this situation there are 3 different [[defining the fourier series|fourier series]] representations:

### Case: Periodic extension
In this case we simply use the half range as it's range


#### Example
> Given the function $g(x)$ over the half range $0\leq x < \pi$ what is it's fourier series

We find the period, which in this case is $\pi$, hence it's half period $L=\frac{\pi}{2}$
