## Fouriers theorem

Fourier’s Theorem essentially states that: If $f(x)$ obeys the Dirichlet conditions then the Fourier series converges, and:
- If $f(x)$ is continous, the series converges to $f(x)$ at a given point $x$
- If $f(x)$ is discontinous at a given point x, at this point x the series converges to the averagfe value at the jump
