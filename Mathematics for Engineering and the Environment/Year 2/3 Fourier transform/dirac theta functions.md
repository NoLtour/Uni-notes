## Dirac theta functions

These are similar to [[heaviside function]] except instead of going to zero under certain conditions they go to $\infty$ at one point, mathematicians [[major coping|cope]] hard if you say they equal infinity but since that's basically the case Ima just say skill issue and define them as:

> ## $$ \delta(x-a) = \begin{dcases}0, &x\neq a\\\infty,&x=a \end{dcases} $$ 
> ## $$  $$
>> where:
>> $H(x)=$ [[heaviside function]]
>> $x=$ independent variable
