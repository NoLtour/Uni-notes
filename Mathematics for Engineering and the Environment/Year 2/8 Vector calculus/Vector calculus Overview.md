# Vector calculus Overview

#### Intro and contents
If at this point you don't know what a [[Scalars and vectors|vector]] is, I don't even know what to say... although the notation I tend to use upto this point is $\underline{v}$, it often doesn't render properly so going forward I use $\vec{v}$ for vectors (using bold is stupid ngl).
- [[MEE Vectors 1|Vectors basic]] <-- really old notes, so they look terrible
- [[dot product (vectors)|dot product]]
- [[cross product (vectors)|cross product]]
- [[scalar fields]]
- [[vector fields]]
- [[formal definition of a parametric curve]]
- [[derivative of a parametric curve]]
- [[line integral of a vector field]]
