## Derivative of a vector field

We can use [[differentiation of a scalar field in the direction of a unit vector|directional derivative]] to differentiate a scalar field, but what about a [[vector fields|vector field]]? It seems there are multiple things that can be classed as "derivatives" and [[divergence operator|divergence]] is one of them.

![[divergence operator|divergence]]

Note that in maths if we have a field with zero divergence it is called solenoidal.
