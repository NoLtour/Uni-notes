## General case of second order linear ODEs

### General definition for all second order linear ODEs

All second order linear ordinary differential  can be defined using the following equation:

> ### $$ A(x) \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + B(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + C(x)y + D(x) = 0 $$ 
>> where:
>> $A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x) =$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$
