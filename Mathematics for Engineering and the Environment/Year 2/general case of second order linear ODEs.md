## General case of second order linear ODEs

### General definition for all second order linear ODEs

All second order linear [[ordinary differential equation]] can be defined using the following equation:

> ### $$ A(x) \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + B(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + C(x)y + D(x) = 0 $$ 
>> where:
>> $A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x) =$ functions of x

Often written in standard form instead (the [[first shitpost of year 2|conversions simple so I'm not proofing it]]):

> ### $$ \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} + p(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = r(x) $$ 

#### Homogeneous equation

This is the special case where $r \equiv 0$
