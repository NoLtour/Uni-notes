#### What are the two
## Derivative symbols
### $d x$
Basically this is the "general case" small distances thing, in the context of something like $\frac{dy}{dx}=$"gradient of tangent of y and x relationship" but if you have some equation such as $y(t,x,z) = t^{3} + 5x - \ln z$ then in this case a function $\frac{dy}{dx}=f(t,x,z)$ is correct for all values of $t,x,z$ while still describing the gradient of the tangent of the y,x relationship. 
For this explanation to make sense you need to check out the one for $\delta x$ + the example.

### $\delta x$
This is used for a [[partial derivative]], it means that for your related values there are no other input variables so $$
