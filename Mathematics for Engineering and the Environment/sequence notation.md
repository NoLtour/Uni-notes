#### 
## Sequence notation

The notation for describing a sequence that we use on this course is:
> ### $$ \{ x_{k} \}^{n}_{k=0} $$ 
> ### $$ x_{0} = 0^{th}\:element $$
> ### $$ x_{n+1} = f(x) $$
>> where:
>> $n=$ number of iterations
>> $k=$ iteration variable (increments by 1 each run)
>> $x_{k}=$ element at k 
>> $f(x)=$ some iterative function
>> Basically this is a math for l
