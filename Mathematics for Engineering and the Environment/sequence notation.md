#### 
## Sequence notation

### Notation
#### Single
The notation for describing a sequence that we use on this course is:
> ### $$ \{ x_{k} \}^{n}_{k=0} $$ 
> ### $$ x_{0} = 0^{th}\:element $$
> ### $$ x_{n+1} = f(x) $$
>> where:
>> $n=$ number of iterations
>> $k=$ iteration variable (increments by 1 each run)
>> $x_{k}=$ element at k 
>> $f(x)=$ some iterative function
>> [[not really but close enoguh|Basically]] this is a math for loop.

#### Set
The notation for describing a sequence that we use on this course is:
> ### $$ \{ x_{k}, y_{k} \}^{n}_{k=0} $$ 
> ### $$ x_{0} = 0^{th}\:element $$
> ### $$ x_{n+1} = f(x) $$
>> where:
>> $n=$ number of iterations
>> $k=$ iteration variable (increments by 1 each run)
>> $x_{k}=$ element at k 
>> $y_{k}=$ other element at speci k
>> $f(x)=$ some iterative function
>> [[not really but close enoguh|Basically]] this is a math for loop.



### Example
$$\begin{align*}
\{  \} &= 
\end{align*}$$
