#### How can we find the
## Second derivative using chain rule
Basically for second derivatives the [[What's the chain rule|chain rule]] becomes [[something something technical temrmrs|kinda fuky]]
> ### $$ \frac{d^{2}x}{dy^{2}} = \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} / \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{3} $$ 

> ### $$ \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}} = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{dy}{dx} = \left(\frac{d}{dt} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\right) \times \frac{dt}{dx} $$
