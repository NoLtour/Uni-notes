#### Define
## Codomain ([[function|functions]])
### Def
The set of outputs of a function, they are the [[slave variable]]s of the function.

### Example
> Given the [[domain (functions)|domain]] of the function $f(x)=5x+e^{x}+2$ is $0\leq x<10$ what is the functions codomain?

$$\begin{align*}
f_{min} &= 5(x_{min}) + e^{x_{min}} + 2 & f_{max} &= 5(x_{max}) + e^{x_{max}} + 2\\
&= e^{0} + 1 & &= 5\times10 + e^{10} + 2\\
&= 2 & &= 52 + e^{10}
\end{align*}$$

Hence the [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] is: $2\leq f(x) < e^{10} +2$

Note that it may be nessisary to draw a graph to ensure the [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] applies in the way you expect, here that wasn't needed since the behaviour is predictable.
