#### What is a
## Function
Put simply a function is a rule that maps one set of values onto another, where each input value corresponds to a single output value.

The input value determines the output value (called a [[slave variable]]).

There are two ways of representing a function:
> ### $$ f:x \to y $$
> ### $$ y = f(x)$$ 
>> where:
>> $y=$ [[slave variable]]
>> $x=$ input variable (an argument of $f$)
>> $f=$ function of $x$

The [[domain (functions)|domain]] and [[codomain (functions)|codomain]] are also relevent definitions that should be learned.
