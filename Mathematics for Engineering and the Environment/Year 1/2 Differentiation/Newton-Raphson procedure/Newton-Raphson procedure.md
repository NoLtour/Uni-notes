# Newton-Raphson procedure
This is a method used to find increasingly accurate solutions to non-linear equations.

Basically you go to a point on the line and then extend a tangent from that point, where the tangent intercepts the x axis is your new approximation of x. This method can find an accurate approximation of x quite quickly.
