#### What are the equations associated with
## Powers of trigonometric functions and multiple angles
These can be derived using the tears of mathematicians ([[they do not cry since anyone on that kind of course must be a masachist|true]]) and the stuff covered so far in [[Complex numbers 2 overview]]:

> ### $$ z^{-n} = \cos n\theta - i \sin n\theta $$ 
> ### $$ z^{n} + z^{-n} = 2 \cos n\theta $$ 
> ### $$ z^{n} - z^{-n} = 2i \sin n \theta $$
