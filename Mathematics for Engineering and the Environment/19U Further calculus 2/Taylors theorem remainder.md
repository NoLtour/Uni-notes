## Taylors theorem remainder
This is something that can be slapped onto the end of a approximation of a function that uses [[Taylor series|Taylors theorem]] to represent the uncalculated "remainder" from the infinite unrepresented terms, which makes the approximate function equivalent to the actual function.
There are many ways to calculate the remainder, but here we use [[Taylors theorem remainder|Lagranges form]].

> ### $$ f(x) = p_{n} (x) + R_{n}(x) $$ 
> ### $$ R_{n}(x) = \frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{n+1 } f^{n+1} (a+\theta h) $$
>> where:
>> $p_{n}(x)=$ the first $n$ terms of the [[Taylor series]] for the function $f(x)$ 
>> $R_{n}(x)=$ the remainder (here shown in [[Taylors theorem remainder|Lagranges form]])
>> $h=x-a$
>> $0<\theta<1$
>> Note these bottom requirements are important
