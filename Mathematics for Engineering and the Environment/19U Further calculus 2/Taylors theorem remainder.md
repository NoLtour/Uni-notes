## Taylors theorem remainder
This is something that can be slapped onto the end of a approximation of a function that uses [[Taylor series|Taylors theorem]] to represent the uncalculated "remainder" from the infinite unrepresented terms, which makes the approximate function equivalent to the actual function.

> ### $$ f(x) = p_{n} (x) + R_{n}(x) $$ 
> ### $$ R_{n}(x) = \frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{n+1 } f^{n+1} (a+\theta h) $$
>> where:
>> $p_{n}(x)=$ the first $n$ terms of the [[Taylor series]] for the function $f(x)$ 
>> $R_{n}(x)=$ the remainder in [[Taylors theorem remainder|Lagranges form]]
>> $h=x-a$
>> $0<\theta<1$
