Sometimes you need to find limits in the form:
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} 
\end{align*}$$
Where $f(a)=g(a)=0$ but $\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ does have a definite value, since $0/0$ is invalid so substitution of $x=a$ wont work, what can be done instead is using:

> ### $$  = $$ 
>> where:
>> $=$ 
>> $=$
>> $=$
