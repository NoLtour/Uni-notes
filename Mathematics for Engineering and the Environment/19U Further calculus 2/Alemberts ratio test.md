#### What is
## Alemberts [[get retio ed|ratio]] test

Basically it's the idea that if we have some series then using the ratio of consecutive terms we can tell if it diverges:

> ### $$ \begin{align*}\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} < 1 &: converges\\\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} > 1 &: diverges\\\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}} = 1 &: unknown\end{align*} $$ 

There is also this for where the sequence has both positive and negative terms:
