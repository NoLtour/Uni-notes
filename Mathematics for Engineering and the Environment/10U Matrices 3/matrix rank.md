#### What is
## Matrix rank
There are some funkey definitions but just go with: "the number of rows that contain things other than zero once the matrix is in [[matrix echelon form]]"

$$\begin{align*}
&\begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 3 & 2 \\ 
0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}\\
\end{align*}$$
