#### How can we determine the
## Types of solution to linear equations using matrices

![[Pasted image 20211223162423.png]]

If we have a [[matrix in echelon form]] as shown above that is acompanyed by a [[column vector]] containing solutions (here we have it in [[adjoint matrix]] form) then the following rules apply (here this is for solving sets of linear equations):
1) If the rank of the [[augmented matrix]] is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix the set of linear equations are [[inconsistant equations|inconsistant]].
2) If the ranks of these matrices are equal then the system has one set of solutions and is [[consistant equations|consistant]].
3) If the rank of the coefficient matrix is higher than the [[augmented matrix]] then the equations has infinate solutions and is [[consistant equations|consistant]].

Note that:
Rank of [[augmented matrix]] = $u$
Rank of coefficient matrix = rank of the matrix containing the single numerical equivilences of each equation (not sure if I phrased that well, the skinny matrix that goes on the right, though you will need to go from [[augmented matrix]] back to the origional split form [[augmented matrix#^5130a9|example]])

### Example
