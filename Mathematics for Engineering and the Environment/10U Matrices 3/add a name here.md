If we have a [[matrix in echelon form]] as shown above that is acompanyed by a [[column vector]] containing unkowns and other containing values then the following rules apply to what solutions the unkowns have:
1) If $x \neq 0$ then the equations are [[inconsistant equations|inconsistant]]
2) If $v=0$ then the equations are [[consistant equations|consistant]], the solution has $(n-m)$ [[free parameters]]
