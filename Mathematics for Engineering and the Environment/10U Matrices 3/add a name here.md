If we have a [[matrix in echelon form]] as shown above that is acompanyed by a [[column vector]] containing solutions (here we have it in [[adjoint matrix]] form) then the following rules apply (here this is for solving sets of linear equations):
1) If $x \neq 0$ then the equations are [[inconsistant equations|inconsistant]]
2) If $v=0$ then the equations are [[consistant equations|consistant]], the solution has $(n-m)$ [[free parameters]] (I think the book is supposed to say [[free variables]] but honestly not sure?)
