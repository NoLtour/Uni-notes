If we have a [[matrix in echelon form]] as shown above that is acompanyed by a [[column vector]] containing solutions (here we have it in [[adjoint matrix]] form) then the following rules apply (here this is for solving sets of linear equations):
1) If the rank of the [[augmented matrix]] is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix the set of linear equations are [[inconsistant equations|inconsistant]].
2) If the ranks of these matrices are equal then the system has one set of solutions and is [[consistant equations|consistant]].
3) If the rank of the coefficient matrix is higher than the [[augmented matrix]] then the equations has infinate solutions.
