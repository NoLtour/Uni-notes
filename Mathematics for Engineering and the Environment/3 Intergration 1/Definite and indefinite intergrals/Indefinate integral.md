#### What's a
## Indefinate integral

Basically if you look at [[Intergration notation]], when we use constants for a and b then we call that a definate integral which in itself is just a number. But indefinate integrals are more fun as they produce functions instead. 

#### Notation

> You can denote a indefinate integral in two ways:
> $$\int f(x)dx$$
> $$or$$
> $$\int^{x}f(t)dt$$

For example:

$$ \int (x^{2}- 1)dx $$

becomes the function:

$$\frac{1}{3}x^{3}- x + c$$

which is of course an indefinate integral.
