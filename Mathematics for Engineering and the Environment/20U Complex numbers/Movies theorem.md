#### What is
## Movies theorem
I am fully aware of the title. My [[french (eww)|response]].

Anyway this is the thing:

> ### $$ z^{n} = r^{n} e^{in\theta} = r^{n} ( \cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta )  $$ 
>> where:
>> $z=$ some imaginary number
>> $r=|z|=$ magnitude of $z$
>> $\theta=$ angle of $z$ from the real axis
>> $i=\sqrt{-1}$
