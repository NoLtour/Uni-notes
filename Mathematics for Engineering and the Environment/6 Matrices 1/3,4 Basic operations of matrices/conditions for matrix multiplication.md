#### What are the
## Conditions for matrix multiplication
### Rule
For any two matrices $A$,$B$, $A\cdot B$ is only possible if: ($A$'s number for columns) = ($B$'s number of rows)

So expressed nicely:

> ### $$ AB \: is \: valid $$ 
>> when:
>> $A=$ matrix with dimentions ($a \times n$) 
>> $B=$ matrix with dimentions ($n \times b$)
