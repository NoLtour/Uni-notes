#### What's the method for
## Newton-Raphson

> $$ x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \dfrac{f(x_n)}{\dot{f}(x_n)} $$ 
>> where:
>> $f(x) =$ a continous non linear function

If trying to find a solution for something like $x+x^2=5$ you would rearrange to $x+x^2-5=0$ and then use the newton raphson method with $f(x) = x+x^2-5$
