#### What's the
## Extended form of the chain rule
This just builds from [[What's the chain rule]], but instead of 2 derivatives being used you use even more (3 or more {shoching I know} )

lets say you have:

$$ 
\begin{align*}
&r = f_1(y)\\
&x = f_2(b)\\
&b = f_2(r)
\end{align*}
$$

Then you could find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ by:

$$ \dfrac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dr}{dy} \frac{dx}{db} \frac{db}{dr}$$

Kinda ez
