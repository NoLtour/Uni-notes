## Payload selection
 
### Objectives structure
To select a payload you'll first need a concrete idea of what actually needs measuring, which for any mission should be determinable from it's objectives.

Missions have a "one-liner" known as the "mission statement" which provides a short brief in the overall purpose of the mission.

Missions also have some more detailed objectives, each objective:
- Has it's aim quantitatively described
- Must provide a realistic goal under the budget constraint
- Incorporate the users needs and mission requirements
- Be appropriate for the unique operating environment (space)
  
### Payload integration

Something to keep in mind is the ENTIRE point of the spacecraft is to ensure the payload is operating correctly, so the payload informs all spacecraft design and constraints on the spacecrafts capabilities (either budgetary or technological) limit what payloads are possible.
