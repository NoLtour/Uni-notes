## Remote sensor types

### Passive vs active

#### Passive

Passive sensor's just measure their environment without actively sending out the relevant waves for reflection detection:

For example camera's tend to be passive sensors, they rely on environmental light.

Trade-offs:
- Cheaper
- Lower energy intensity
- Less reliable (source availability)
- Increased noise (source output variation)

#### Active

Active sensors measure the result of their transmission:

Properties of the target can be deduced from how the transmission reflected/diffracted.

Trade-offs:
- Expensive
- High energy intensity
- Reliable
- Controllable output level
