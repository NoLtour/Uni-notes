## Remote sensing (aerospace)
### Definition
Remote sensing is the measurement of object properties on the Earthâ€™s surface using data acquired from aircraft and satellites.

### Instrument characteristics

All remote sensors can have their abilities quantified by the following properties:

- Spatial resolution, the spacing between pixel samples on the Earth
- Spectral resolution, measurement of ability to resolve spectral features
- Radiometric resolution, the number of bits per pixel
- Temporal resolution, time between re-imaging of target (revisit time)
- Swath width, the width of the area being scanned

#### Trade offs

There are a multitude of reasons, causing "high spatial resolution = low spectral resolution":
- Bandwidth limitations, having both large spatial and spectral resolutions leads to significant increases in the data size of the scan. With the limited data transfer methods from earth to space it may not be possible to parse the huge quantity of data faster than it is scanned
- Cost, can be expensive

The bandwidth trade off also applies to swath width, hence why we can't use a single satellite to create super high resolution images of the entire surface of the earth.
