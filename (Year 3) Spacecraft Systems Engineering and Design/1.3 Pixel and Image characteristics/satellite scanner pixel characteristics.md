### Term defs
#### Instantaneous field of view (IFOV)
IFOV (Instantaneous Field of View) represents the minor angle in a projection of the sensor's view after exiting the lens or optical system. It defines the angular size of an individual pixel or detector element in the sensor array. IFOV is crucial in determining the level of detail that the sensor can capture, and it influences the spatial resolution of the resulting images.

#### Ground-projected instantaneous field of view (GIFOV)

GIFOV is the IFOV that has been projected onto the Earth's surface. It accounts for the effect of the satellite's altitude and viewing angle, indicating the area on the ground corresponding to one pixel after considering the satellite's position and orientation.

#### Focal length

Focal length is the distance between the lens (or the mirror) and the image sensor in the satellite sensor system. It determines how much the sensor can zoom in or out and affects the field of view. A shorter focal length results in a wider field of view, while a longer focal length provides a narrower, more zoomed-in view.

#### Altitude

The height of the satellite above the Earth's surface. It is a crucial parameter as it directly influences the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery.

Satellites at higher altitudes tend to have coarser spatial resolution (larger pixels) because they cover larger areas, while satellites at lower altitudes provide finer spatial resolution (smaller pixels) because they can distinguish smaller details on the Earth's surface due to the closer proximity.
