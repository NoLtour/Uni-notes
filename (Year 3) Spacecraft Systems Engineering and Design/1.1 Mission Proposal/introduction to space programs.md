## Introduction to space programs

### Intro

The existence of programs like NASA's Explorer, Discovery, Mars Scout, New Frontiers, and ESA's Cosmic Vision, Earth Explorer, stems from the shared goal of advancing scientific knowledge and exploration. These programs facilitate targeted, innovative missions, enabling scientists to explore the unknown, answer fundamental questions about the universe, study celestial bodies, and understand Earth's complex systems. They exist to push the boundaries of human understanding, fostering technological innovation and discovery for the betterment of humanity.

This is achieved by handing out contracts so that scientific questions can be answered using probes and experiments.

A [[principle investigator]] is tasked with the project then will contract out work where needed to allow for relevant missions to be acomplished.

### Program examples

#### Nasa programs

##### Explorer program 

The Explorer program focuses on small and relatively low-cost spacecraft for specific scientific investigations and experiments, primarily in space physics, astrophysics and heliophysics.

##### Discovery Program 

Discovery missions aim to explore the solar system with a focus on planetary science, origins and astrobiology. These missions are medium-sized and have a cost cap, encouraging innovative and cost-effective approaches.

##### Mars Scout

Mars Scout program was intended for small, focused missions to explore Mars, with an emphasis on innovative technology and efficient mission design.

##### New Frontiers 

New Frontiers missions are medium to large-scale projects targeting various destinations in the solar system, including planets, asteroids, and comets. These missions address key scientific questions about the solar system's history and formation.

#### ESA programs

##### Cosmic vision

Cosmic Vision is the European Space Agency's long-term plan for space science missions. It aims to address fundamental questions about the Universe, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the formation of stars and galaxies, and the potential for life elsewhere in the Universe. Cosmic Vision includes various mission classes, from small to large, to achieve these scientific goals.

##### Earth explorer

Earth Explorer missions are focused on studying Earth and its environment. These missions aim to understand Earth's processes, including its climate, atmosphere, and geology. Earth Explorer missions use advanced technologies to monitor and collect data on various Earth-related phenomena, helping scientists better comprehend the Earth system and its changes.
