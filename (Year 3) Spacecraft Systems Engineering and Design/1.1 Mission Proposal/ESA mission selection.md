1) Phase 0: Proposals are evaluated and a mission concept is developed, assessing its scientific and technical feasibility. Independent review determines which proposals move forward.
2) Phase A: Detailed mission design and preliminary activities are conducted to refine the concept. Further evaluation refines the proposals and establishes a baseline for mission implementation.
3) Phase B/C/D: Detailed technical analyses refine mission design, leading to Critical Design Review (CDR). Components are manufactured, integrated, and tested (Phase B). The mission is prepared, launched, operated in space, and data collected for analysis (Phase C/D). Selected proposals are implemented, monitored, and managed throughout these stages.
4) Further phases exist relating to end of life stuff
