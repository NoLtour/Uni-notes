## Protected orbital regions

As touched on in the [[IDAC]], LEO and GEO are really important. This leads to them having a "protected" status:

The exact locations of these regions are defined as:
- LEO, spherical region from surface to 2000 km
- GEO, [[obit selection#Geostationary orbit|geostationary orbit]] spherical shell of $\pm200\:km$ around geo orbit. Constrained between [[latitude]] $\pm15\degree$
