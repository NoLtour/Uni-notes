## Space debris

tldr: Space trash moving 10x faster than a bullet

Pretty much anything and everything will become space debris given enough time, so it needs to be removed before that happens.

Some thing's like disposable fairings and boosters become debris instantly, other things breakdown or wear and separate to become debris.

Fun thing is size doesn't matter much when your moving 8km/s, even a 0.5g fleck of paint can break a satellite... so yeah this is a problem.

(Fin fact that smiley face in the impact is actually a [[detached shock]], mf was moving so fast it broke the speed of sound in metal (easily))
