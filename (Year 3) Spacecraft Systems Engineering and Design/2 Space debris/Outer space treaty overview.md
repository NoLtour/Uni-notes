# Outer space treaty overview

(and yes the o is not capitalised, that is out of disrespect for this [[it is bad and sucks I want to do space mining|cringe treaty]])

#### Contents
The underlying principles of the outer space treaty are:
- Space should be used for the benefit of all mankind, cannot perform activities that would harm other participants and must consult others if it's believed it may
- Things in space cannot be claimed
- Weapons of mass destruction cannot be stored in space
- Astronauts must be given consideration by all countries as envoys of mankind, as such if they land in your country you must help and inform their origin country
- States are liable for the activities of themselves and their constituents activities
- Don't contaminate space (biological and debris
- Countries are liable for their spacecraft falling back to Earth if damage is caused
- Countries own whatever they put into space even once it falls back to earth
- States must inform the public, scientific community and UN of activities they plan to do, to the maximum possible extent

It's a treaty enforced by the UN left over from the cold war days, it's basically impossible to change since it needs complete consensus and has like 100 participants. 

As space becomes more developed countries are starting to ignore clauses. lmao.
