## Orbital precession

Orbital precession refers to the slow, continuous rotation or change in the orientation of an orbit's elliptical path over time.

Generally the thing's causing [[orbital precession]] are really weak, but in space where these can act for years it doesn't take much to eventually cause massive drift. Some examples of forces include:
- Gravitational Forces from Other Celestial Bodies: The gravitational pull from other planets and celestial bodies, such as the Moon and the Sun, exerts forces on an orbiting object, contributing to precession.
- Equatorial Bulge of the Earth: Earth is not a perfect sphere; it bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation. This bulge creates a gravitational pull on orbiting objects, contributing to precession.
- Solar Forces (Solar Oblateness): The Sun is not a perfect sphere either; it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This solar oblateness exerts gravitational forces on objects in orbit around it, leading to orbital precession.
- Solar Pressure: Solar radiation exerts pressure on objects in space, including satellites. This pressure can cause a tiny but continuous force that affects the satellite's orbit, leading to orbital precession over time. The effect is more pronounced for lightweight objects with large surface areas, like solar sails.

This page is basically just a fancy way of saying [[space drag]].
