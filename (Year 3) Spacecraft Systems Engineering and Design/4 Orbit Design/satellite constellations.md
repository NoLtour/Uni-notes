## Satellite constellations

### Intro

A constellation is a collection of satellites of (usually) similar design, performing similar functions simultaneously in similar orbits.

A significant number of satellites exist as a part of a [[satellite constellations|constellation]], these allow for very flexible operating area's and periods by making use of a network of many satellites instead of just one. In recent years there has been a increase in [[obit selection|LEO]] constellations for communications due to the low latency and low power requirements.

Of course there are disadvanteges to [[satellite constellations|constellations]], mainly cost and complexity. In some cases such as achieving [[geostationary coverage|GEO style coverage]] it may be possible to do so for less using a [[satellite constellations|constellation]], but it is still extremely expensive as multiple satellites need to be maintained, tracked, managed and launched.

Both GPS and starlink can be described as [[satellite constellations|constellations]].

### Coverage

Generally constellations can be described interms of their number of orbital planes and satellites per plane.

In this image GLONASS (Communist GPS) is shown:
- Total 24 satellites
- 3 orbital planes
- 8 satellites per orbital plane
- Quadruple coverage is provided, wherein you always have access to 4 satellites

#### Overlap

Depending on orbital spacing, constellations can be designed to maintain certain levels of overlap on area coverage.

The number of satellites required to ensure a minimum number of accessible satellites (single, double, tripple coverage... ect) is a function of: altitude, coverage required and the
minimum elevation angle. Obviously higher satellites require fewer satellites as they cover a larger area:
