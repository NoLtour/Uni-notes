## Van Allen radiation belts

The Van Allen radiation belts are two concentric regions of charged particles (mainly electrons and protons) trapped by Earth's magnetic field. They encircle the planet and are divided into an inner and outer belt. These belts can affect spacecraft and are important for understanding space weather.
