## Doppler effect

### Description

The Doppler effect, named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, is a change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the source of the wave. It is commonly observed in sound waves, light waves, and other types of waves.

### Visualisation

In the following we see two sources outputting the same frequency, but a ground station behind the mobile source would detect a considerably lower frequency!
