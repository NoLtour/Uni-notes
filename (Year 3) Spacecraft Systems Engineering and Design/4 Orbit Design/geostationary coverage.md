## Geostationary coverage

### Coverage

Since GEO is be definition in plane with the equator, it can't cover the poles:

The coverage will of course be lower than the theoretical $\theta_{max}$ due to operational elevation angles being non zero ([[calculating orbital coverage]]). Further reducing the coverage.

In most cases this isn't such a huge issue though, since most people don't live in/near the poles.

#### Equatorial total coverage

We can calculate the minimum number of satellites needed for total coverage of the equator.
