## Walker-Delta and Walker-Star constellations

### Common features

[[multivariable systems in state space form]]

All orbits are the circular, at the same height, the same inclination, and the ascending nodes of the orbit planes are evenly distributed around the equator.

> ### $$\begin{align*} I &= \left\{\begin{aligned} &\frac{360\degree}{p},&\text{Walker delta} \\&\frac{180\degree}{p},&\text{Walker star} \end{aligned}\right. \end{align*}$$

> ### $$\begin{align*} t &= p \cdot s \end{align*}$$
>> where:
>> $t=$ total number of satellites
>> $p=$ number of planes
>> $s=$ number of satellites in a plane
>> $I=$ angle between consecutive orbital planes

A significant advantage of this arrangement is that orbital perturbations act similarly on all orbits, meaning constellation geometry (intersatellite positioning) is somewhat consistent.
