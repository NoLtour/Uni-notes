## IDAC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee)

### Purpose

The IADC is an international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of artificial and natural [[space debris]]. 

Their purpose is to manage [[space debris]] they do this by cooperation and operating according to standards.


### Mitigation guidelines
These are also pretty much the guidelines the UN has endorsed:
- Limit debris released during normal operations
- Minimize potential for post-mission break-ups resulting from stored energy
- Prevention of on-orbit collisions
- Minimize the potential for break-ups during operational phases
- Avoidance of intentional destruction and other harmful activities
- Require post mission disposal: geosynchronous region
- Require post mission disposal: objects passing through the LEO region

The last 2 point's are basically just adding extra emphasis that the most useful regions of space need extra attention.
