## Mitigating orbital break-ups

### Intro
No this isn't [[seeth|relationship advice]].

The largest potential to increase space debris is one thing becoming lot's of things:
- Spent stage separation
- Mechanical wear releasing particles/chunks
- Pipe/tank/battery rupture
- Explosions (intentional (looking at you China), or otherwise)
- Collisions

### Mitigation

##### Batteries
Interrupt power supply Limit battery re-charging to prevent overcharging.

##### Explosives and pyrotechnics
Don't.

##### Reaction wheels and gyros
Don't excessively store KE.
