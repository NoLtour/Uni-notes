## Delta wings

This is kinda shoehorned in since it doesn't use any of the equation's we've derived in [[Finite wing theory overview|finite wing theory]]... [[guess they had to put it somewhere so why not here|lol]].

The way these fucks generate lift is completely different, they intentionally create the vortecies at the tip of the craft then those vortecies attach to the surface of the wing and produce lift.

This is useful for producing lift in supersonic travel but in the subsonic case are also used because they work for really high AOA without stalling:

AKA these are useful for fighters where manoverability is especially important.
