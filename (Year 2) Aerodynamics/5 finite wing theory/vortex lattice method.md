## Vortex lattice method

So unlike in [[numerical method for determining circulation distribution|this method for determining circulation distrobution]] here we will be breaking the wing into panels instead of sections spanning the entire chord. Then apply everything we know about flow conditions on both the top and bottom and apply [[Helmholtz theorem and Biot-Savart law|Biot-Savart law]] can get induced velocity then apparently we do the sub back in shit from [[numerical method for determining circulation distribution|this method for determining circulation distrobution]]. It looks beyond the scope of what we need to properly understand tbh, I don't get this implementation but it would be able to produce information about the pressure distribution across the whole surface of the wing which is neat. [[too much complicated for 1pm notes|idk]] look at the single slide on it:
