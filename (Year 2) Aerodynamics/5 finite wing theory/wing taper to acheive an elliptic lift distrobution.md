## Wing taper to acheive an elliptic lift distrobution

We've already shown in [[general lift distrobution for a finite wing]] that the close you get to an elliptic lift distrobution the lower your induced drag, but making an elliptical wing is a huge pain in the ass... so to get a descent approximation why not just taper the wing?

Here it can be seen that by just tapering it once there is a significant improvement in [[Oswald efficiency factor]] and hence reduction in induced drag. It can also be seen on the chart that not only does the efficiency distrobution vary with [[wing aspect ratio]] but also the maximum efficiency [[taper ratio]] for a single taper is about 0.6 regardless of aspect ratio.

But why stop at one taper? Lets slap on another one!

I wanted to keep slapping on more and more tapers but once you get to 2 you've pretty much already got to an elliptic distrobution. At this point the efficiency gains of further tapering are really small so it's generally better to focus resources on improving other aspects of the design such as the fuesaladge.
