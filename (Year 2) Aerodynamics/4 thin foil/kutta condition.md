## Kutta condition
As discussed previously we need to figure out how to distribute [[circulation]] along the foil such that it mimics the real life distribution if we want to get any useful info out of the model, the way we do this is by defining boundary conditions:

This is known as the Kutta condition, that for any air foil at the tip the velocity on top and below is the same (since at the point both the top and bottom intercept there is only enough information capacity in a single point to store a single velocity value).
