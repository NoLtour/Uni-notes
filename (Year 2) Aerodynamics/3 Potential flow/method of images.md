## Method of images
When we want to model flows near the surface, we need to be able to enforce the presence of the wall in some manner, all a wall is in reality is a line where there is no normal velocity... so the obvious thing to do is just place equal opposite objects using where we want the wall to be as a mirror line:

Doing this results in the normal velocities cancelling each other out at the point of equal distance which results in "[[build a wall to keep those damn normal velocitys out|a wall]]".
