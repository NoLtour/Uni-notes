## Turbulent vs laminar [[boundary layer separation]]
### Separation conditions

Something to note about boundary layer separation is that since it's caused by a lack of momentum close to the wall it occurs later when considering turbulant flows than laminar flows, this is because the mixing of turbulant flows leads to more momentum in the air near the wall.

Hence why we induce turbulence with things like [[preventing boundary layer separation|dimples]].

Example of BL separation with laminar vs turbulant flow:

### Net drag
Of course turbulant flow does lead to increased [[skin drag|skin friction]] but it is often the case that this increase in skin friction is much less than the reduction caused by delaying BL separation.
