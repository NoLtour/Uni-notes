## Characteristics of boundary layers on an aerofoil

### [[curl of a vector|Vorticity]] in a boundary layer

[[curl of a vector|Vorticity]] can be seen here in blue and red, where darker colours indicate higher values and red/blue indicates sign. As can be seen [[boundary layer|boundary layers]] always have [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] which is to be expected since they are defined as the region between the [[freestream]] and the surface on which the [[fluid no slip condition|no slip condition]] occurs. The characterisation of the [[boundary layer|turbulent boundary layer]] and [[boundary layer|laminar boundary layer]] can be clearly seen by the occurrence of varied directions of [[curl of a vector|vorticity]] vs uniform direction.

### Velocity profile of boundary layers
#### Laminar

As can be expected in the laminar flow regime there is a smooth transition in velocity between the surface and the [[freestream]], and when viewing a point over time the velocity is constant (hence [[steady flow]]).

#### Turbulent

(left diagram shows velocity profile from foil (y being normal distance), right shows how the velocity at some point on that vel profile changes with time)

In contrast to the laminar flow regime you can see that at this instantaneous point in time the velocity is jagged though a transition to [[freestream]] can still be observed, and as expected the velocity at some point in the profile changes with time.

It should be noted that if a sensor with a low frequency response is used (such as a pitot probe) to measure velocity at some point it would naturally average the reading.
